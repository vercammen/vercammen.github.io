    <p>When you visit the CME website and choose the Settlements tab for a commodity such as corn you can choose to see the daily price and transaction data for a set of option contracts that are associated with that commodity. The purpose of this module is to describe how an option contract works, how the payoffs from an option contract are determined and the sensitivity of the option contract's selling price to parameter changes such as the level of futures price volatility and the number of days until the contract expires. The first section of this module provides a general overview of option contracts. This overview includes a discussion of option contract jargon such as "strike price", "in the money" and "intrinsic value". The second section is devoted to constructing payoff diagrams for options sellers and option buyers. The last section is used to conduct sensitivity analysis using a series of simulated payoffs for a call option and using the calculated values of the marginal impacts, which are known as the "Greeks".</p> 

    <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a001"></a>(i) Overview of Commodity Options</h3> 
        
    <p>Stock options, which are often included in the compensation package of the CEO of a large corporation, are widely used and are generally well understood. The call option allows the CEO to purchase stock of her company at a predetermined strike price at any time on or before the expiry of the option contract. If the share price remains below the strike price and the option is set to expire, the CEO will not exercise her option to purchase shares. The call option incentivizes the CEO to work hard because for every dollar increase in the share price above the option's strike price is a dollar of compensation for the CEO. An alternative strategy (seldom used in the real world) is to force the CEO to hold put options. If the CEO performs well and the share price rises above the strike price then the put option will not be exercised. If instead the CEO performs poorly and the stock price falls below the strike price then the board of directors can exercise the put option, which forces the CEO to purchase stock at the current share price and thus take a financial hit.</p>
    
    <p>Exercising a call option on a commodity futures contact gives the holder of the option a long position in the futures market at the option's strike price. If this long position is offset with a short position then the call's payoff is equal to the futures price when the call is exercised minus the strike price. Similarly, exercising a put option on a commodity futures contract gives the holder a short futures position at the option's strike price. If this short position is offset with a long position then the put's payoff is equal to the strike price minus the futures price when the put is exercised. It follows that a call option will be exercised only if the futures price is above the strike price, and a put option will be exercised only if the futures price is below the strike price.</p>

    </p>

    <p>A futures contact is an obligation to accept delivery or make delivery of the commodity. This obligation can be offset but it cannot be resold to another trader. In contrast, an option contract is initially written/sold by a professional (often a firm) and this contract can be resold and repurchased many times before either the option expires without being exercised or it is exercised on or before the expiry date. For agricultural commodities the CME trades American-style options, which allows the holder to exercise before the option expires. An European-style option can only be exercised at the point that it expires (see <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/american-european-options.asp" target="_blank">Investopedia</a>).</p> 
    
    <p>There are dozens of call and put options that trade for a commodity such as corn at a given point in time. This is because options have different strike prices and different expiry dates. For the case of CME corn, Figure 2-A-1 shows the range of strike prices and expiry dates that a trader can choose as of August, 2019.</p>

    <p>Figure 2-A-2 shows the volume of trade of call and put corn options (December, 2019 expiry) as of August 6, 2019. The horizontal axis shows the range of strike prices. The August 6, 2019 futures price is superimposed to serve as a benchmark. Notice that call options are more heavily traded than put options. Moreover, most of the traded call options are "out of the money", meaning that the current futures is below the strike price. Most of the traded put options are also out of the money, meaning that the current futures is above the strike price. The CME website reports open interest for each type of option that is actively being traded. For example, on August 6 the volume and open interest of an at the money call option with a strike price of 4100 ($4.10/bu) was 1,183 and 18,861, respectively. The analogous values for a put option with a strike price of 4100 is 400 and 17,304, respectively. These values demonstrate that at a given point in time the fraction of outstanding options which are actively traded is relatively small (i.e., 1183/18861 for a call, and 400/17304 for a put). </p>

    <p>Figure 2-A-3 is a partial screen capture of the settle price and transaction data for call and put corn options as of August 6, 2019. The top of the chart shows that December futures settled at 412'4 ($4.125/bu). The bottom part of the chart shows the prices of call and put options which expire in December of 2019. For example, a call option is priced at 28'3 ($0.284/bu) if the strike price is 4000 ($4.00/bu) and is priced at 20'3 ($0.204/bu) if the strike price is 4200 ($4.20/bu). Figure 2-A-3 demonstrates the expected result that call options with a lower strike price are relatively more expensive since the payoff is equal to the futures price minus the strike price. Similarly, the put options with a higher strike price are relatively more expensive. In Module 2-B a theoretical relationship known as "put-call parity" will be used to show how the price a call and the price of a put are inversely related. </p>

    <p>Figure 2-A-3 demonstrates that out of the money options with zero intrinsic value trade at a positive price due to the option's positive time value. The concept of time value is explored in greated deal in the next section but for now it is sufficient to interpret time value as the expected payout given the probability that the futures price will favourably change (e.g., increase for a call and decrease for a put). For an option that is currently in the money, the intrinsic value is the payout if the option was exercised immediately, and the time value is the residual (i.e., the price of the option minus its intrinsic value). For example, on August 6th the price of a December, 2019 futures contract settled at 412'4 ($4.125/bu) and an in the money call option with a strike price of 4000 ($4.00/bu) settled at 28'3 ($0.284/bu). The intrinsic value of this particular call option is 4.125 - 4.00 = $0.125/bu and the time value is 0.284 - 0.125 = $0.159/bu. Notice that the time value of this in the money call is approximately equal to the time value of an out of the money put with a strike price of 4000 ($4.00/bu). </p>

    <p>The firm which writes (i.e., sells the original) call or put option collects the original selling price and in exchange is responsible for making payment to a firm or individual who may eventually exercise the option. There is no limit as to how much the futures price can change (other than remaining non-negative) and for this reason the payment from the option writer to the option exerciser can potentially be very large. In contrast, the most that can be lost by the person or firm which holds the option contract is the original cost of buying the option. The limited loss feature of an option contract makes them suitable to be held by individual investors in the absence of a margin account.</p> 

    <p>Payoff diagrams for European-style options are an effective way to show the potential gains and losses from selling or buying call or put options. Figure 2-A-4 shows a payoff diagram for the case of a buyer of a call option. The horizontal axis is the futures price when the call option is expiring. If the futures price is below the strike price (left side of diagram) then the out of the money call option has zero intrinsic value and it will not be exercised by its holder. In this case the payoff to the option holder is a loss equal to the purchase price of the option. If instead the futures price is above the strike price (right side of diagram) then the in the money call option has positive intrinsic value and it will be exercised by the option holder. The call has to be sufficiently deep in the money in order for the payoff to cover the purchase price of the option. The payoff schedule for the buyer has a slope of 1 for all in the money call options and there is no upper limit on the amount that can be collected when the option is exercised. </p>

    <p>Figure 2-A-5 shows the payoff diagram for the writer/seller of the call option. When the futures price is below the strike price the call option will not be exercised by the holder of the option, in which case the seller's net gain is the price paid by the holder and received by the seller. When the futures price is above the strike price the option will be exercised and the seller of the option is required to pay the holder the difference between the futures price and the strike price. In this region the slope of the payoff function is -1 and there is no upper limit on the size of the payment from the seller to the buyer of the option. If the call option is only slightly in the money then the payout made by the seller will be less than the premium received by the seller, in which case the seller earns a positive net profit on the transaction.</p>

    <p>Figure 2-A-6 is the payoff diagram for the holder of a put option and Figure 2-A-7 is the payoff diagram for the writer of a put option. Notice that these two diagrams are mirror images of Figures 2-A-4 and 2-A-5. Specifically, the put option is not exercised and the price of the option is transferred from the holder of the option to the seller if the futures price is above the strike price. If the futures price is below the strike price then the put option is exercised and the payoff function has a slope of -1 for the option holder and 1 for the option seller. This means that below the strike price the seller transfers to the option holder the full change in the value of the commodity.</p>

    <p>The payoff diagram in Figure 2-A-8 is for a straddle A straddle is created by purchasing one call option and one put option with the same expiry date and the same strike price. With this configuration, either the call component or the put component has intrinsic value at all points in time and thus one of these components will be exercised on the straddle's expiry date. Figure 2-A-8 shows that the net payoff after accounting for the cost of constructing the straddle is positive provided that the futures price moves either sufficiently above or sufficiently below the strike price. As compared to buying an individual call or put, the cost of constructing a straddle position is relatively large. Consequently, a relatively large change in the futures price is required in order for the payout of the straddle to be large enough to cover the cost of constructing the straddle. A straddle is commonly held by traders who are speculating that increased future volatility in the futures price will result in a positive payout from either the call or the put component of the straddle.</p>

    <p>The payoff diagram in Figure 2-A-9 is for a strangle. A strangle is the same as a straddle except now the strike price of the call is greater than the strike price of the put. This difference in strike price creates a zone for the futures price where both the call and put component of the strangle has zero intrinsic value. Strangles are popular amongst investors because they are less expensive to construct as compared to a straddle. This disadvantage is that a larger decrease or a larger increase in the futures price is required in order for a positive payoff to be generated. Constructing an inexpensive strangle by setting the strike price of the call well above the strike price of the put is a popular way to take a long shot position with the hope that an unforeseen event will cause either a large upward or downward surge in the futures price.</p>

    <p>The last payoff diagram to be examined is for a butterfly spread, as illustrated in Figure 2-A-10. A butterfly spread is constructed by simultaneously buying and selling calls and/or put options with different strike prices. Describing the mechanics of a butterfly spread is beyond the scope of this course. What is important to note is that the butterfly spread has limited profit potential and for this reason is relatively inexpensive to construct. Specifically, as Figure 2-A-10 shows the net payoff for the butterfly spread is positive provided that increases or decreases in the futures price are not excessively large. The butterfly spread is a good example of the large number of complex payoff schedules that can be created by combining purchased and sold call and put options with different strike prices. An important limitation of the butterfly spread and other exotic option combinations is that the commission charge for combining the various components can quickly become excessive relative to the size of the expected payoff.</p>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a003"></a>(iii) Option Pricing Sensitivity Analysis</h3>

    <p>A call or put option is different than a commodity futures contract in that the price of these instruments do not reflect fundamentals about supply and demand beyond what is already reflected in the futures price. In other words, if traders knew the stochastic process which governs how the futures price changes over time then all traders would agree on the same price for the option contract. Moreover, their individual beliefs about the market's supply and demand fundamentals is not relevant for the pricing of the option. A popular assumption is that traders agree that futures prices roughly follow a log normal distribution, in which case the Black (1976) option pricing formula can be used to price the option (the Black 1976 formula is often referred to generically as the Black-Scholes formula). One of the parameters which feed into the Black (1976) formula is the future volatility of the log normal price distribution. Traders typically disagree on the level of future volatility, and this disagreement allows for active centralized trading in options contracts.</p>

    <p>The Black (1976) option pricing formula and other pricing formulas that are similar to Black-Scholes have four important parameters: (1) the current futures price; (2) the option contract's strike price; (3) the number of days until the option contract expires; and (4) the volatility of the underlying futures price. A change in the strike price and an opposite change in the current futures price have similar (but not identical) impacts on the price of the option because the intrinsic value of the option is the futures price minus the strike price for a call, and the strike price minus the futures price for the put. For this reason during comparative static analysis it is common to leave the strike price fixed and then focus on how variations in the current futures price affect the price of the option.</p> 
        
    <p>Of interest in this section is how the equilibrium price of an option with a particular strike price, either when it is initially written or when it is subsequently exchanged between traders, is theoretically impacted by changes in the underlying futures price, the expiry date of the contract and futures price volatility. These comparative static results, which are derived using the Black (1976) model, are uniquely identified by a Greek letter. Consequently, the full set of comparative static outcomes are referred to as the "Greeks"</p>
        
    <p> Before presenting the calculated values for the Greeks, it is useful to first describe the comparative static results at a more intuitive level. This is accomplished by examining the expected payoff of a European call option through use of a small scale Monte Carlo analysis. Ideally this sensitivity analysis should take place with the price of the option rather than the expected payoff. Analyzing option price impacts are much more complicated and there is a strong positive relationship between expected payoff impacts and option price impacts. It is therefore reasonable to focus on the sensitivity of the expected payoff to the various parameters.</p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Simulated Payoffs for a Call Option</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p> The simulation begins on September 15, 2019 and ends when the futures contract and call option both expire at the end of December of 2021. December futures are initially trading at $4.00/bu and with normal expectation this price is not expected to systematically increase or decrease over time although traders know it will fluctuate in response to the arrival of new information. Specifically, the futures price is assumed to follow a geometric random walk without drift between September 15th and the expiry of the December contract. This means that the percentage change in the futures price between period t and period t + 1 is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation &sigma;<sup>*</sup>. Prices are generated on a weekly basis which implies that &sigma;<sup>*</sup> = (1/52)<sup>0.5</sup>&sigma;, where &sigma; is a measure of annualized volatility for the price series. The next paragraph describes how existing futures price data can be used to estimate historic annualized volatility</p> 
        
    <p>If the data is daily then the first step when calculating annualized volatility is to take the natural log of the daily price and then create a new series consisting of the first difference of the logged prices. You should convince yourself with a simple example in an Excel worksheet that ln(P<sub>t+1</sub>) - ln(P<sub>t</sub>) is approximately equal to the percentage change in price: (P<sub>t+1</sub> - P<sub>t</sub>)/P<sub>t</sub>. The next step is to calculate the standard deviation of the ln(P<sub>t+1</sub>) - ln(P<sub>t</sub>) data series. Finally, multiply this standard deviation result by the square root of 252 to obtain annualized volatility. The 252 value is approximately equal to the number of trading days in a year. The method described here assumes that volatility remains constant over time. If this is not the case then more sophisticated methods such as ARCH or GARCH should be used to estimate volatility</p>

    <p>Figure 2-A-11 shows estimates of annualized volatility for CBOT corn futures spanning the years 1992 to 2016. This figure comes from a 2017 working paper titled "Future volatility forecast in agricultural commodity markets". It can be accessed <a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/agsaaea17/258480.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. Notice that volatility varies over the course of the marketing year, generally highest just prior to harvest and lowest just after harvest. Also notice that corn prices are significantly more volatile in the second half of the sample (2006 - 2016) as compared to the first half (1992 - 2005).</p>

    <p>Based on Figure 1-A-11 it is appropriate to simulate the corn futures price with both a low  (&sigma; = 15 percent) and high (&sigma; = 30 percent) level of annualized futures price volatility. The Excel worksheet that is used to generate the prices can be found <a href="other_2a/corn_price_simulation.xlsx">here</a>. A typical Monte Carlo simulation procedure consists of generating tens of thousands of September to December price series and then averaging the results which are attached to each series. This large number of replications is not required to illustrate the general properties of the expected payout of a call option. The simulations which appear in Figures 2-A-12 (high volatility) and 2-A-13 (low volatility) assume just 10 replications. </p>

    <p>The dashed horizontal lines in Figures 2-A-12 and 2-A-13 imply alternative assumptions about the strike price for the call option. In Figure 2-A-12, the lower line at $3.70/bu (labeled S<sub>I</sub>) implies that the call option is in the money relative to the initial $4.00/bu futures price. Similarly, the upper line at $4.10/bu (labeled S<sub>O</sub>) implies that the call option is initially out of the money. The European call option is exercised only if the futures price at the end of December, 2021 is above the strike price, in which case the payoff is the vertical difference between the December, 2021 price and the strike price.</p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Properties of Simulated Payoffs for Call Option</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p> Figures 2-A-12 and 2-A-13 illustrate three important results concerning how the expected payoff of the call option is impacted by the parameters which define the call (the expected payoff is the straight average of the 10 simulated payoffs). Each are discussed in turn.</p> 
        
    <p><i>Futures - Strike Wedge</i>: Let Z equal the Futures - Strike wedge, which is defined as the initial (September, 2019) futures price minus the strike price. For a call option, a positive (negative) value for Z implies that the call option is initially in the money (out of the money). Figure 2-A-12 shows that a larger value for Z implies a higher expected payoff for the call option. For example, suppose the initial futures price is held fixed at $4.00/bu and the strike price is reduced by $0.05. In this case Z increases by $0.05/bu. The lower strike price relative to the initial futures price results in both more of the simulated price series ending up in the money, and a greater gap between the futures price and the strike price for those price series which do end up in the money. Thus, a larger value for Z necessarily implies a higher expected payoff for the call option.</p>
        
    <p>A less obvious result concerns how the impact of a higher Z on the expected payoff depends on the size of Z. For the call option that is initially in the money (i.e., the bottom dashed line labeled S<sub>I</sub>), an increase in Z by $0.05/bu will increase the average payoff for the call option by an amount that is close to $0.05/bu. This is because as Figure 2-A-12 shows that there is a strong likelihood that a call option which begins highly in the money will remain in the money. When an option is expected to remain in the money then a $0.05/bu increase in Z will translate into a largely $0.05/bu increase in the expected payoff. In contrast, for a call option that is initially out of the money (i.e., the upper dashed line labeled S<sub>I</sub>), the increase in Z by $0.05/bu will increase the expected payoff of the call option by just a small amount. This result emerges because the odds are relatively low that the call option will expire in the money. If the call option does not expire in the money even with the $0.05/bu increase in Z, then this increase will have had no impact on the call's payoff.</p>

    <p><i>Annualized Volatility</i>: A comparison of the high volatility price series in Figure 2-A-12 and the low volatility price series in Figure 2-A-13 reveals how differences in the annualized volatility of the futures price affects the payoff of the call option. Notice that for both low and high volatility the option expires in the money three out of ten times. However, for the calls that do finish in the money, they tend to be much deeper in the money for the high volatility case (Figure 2-A-12) as compared to the low volatility case (Figure 2-A-13). Consequently, the payoff of the call option is expected to be higher with the higher level of price volatility. A more general interpretation of this result is that if the upside potential gain from holding the option is unlimited and the maximum downside potential loss from holding the option is the initial cost of the option, then large price swings give rise to higher gains without the corresponding offsetting losses.</p>   
                
    <p><i>Time Horizon</i>: The third important comparative static result concerns how a longer time horizon affects the expected payoff of the call option. Unlike the first two results, this property is difficult to observe in Figures 2-A-12 and 2-A-13. Consider instead Figure 2-A-14, which illustrates a simple additive binomial model of option pricing. With this model P<sub>t+1</sub> is equal to P<sub>t</sub> + M with probability 0.5 and is equal to P<sub>t</sub> - M with probability 0.5. This assumption ensures that the option's payoff depends on the total number of periods that price increased and not on the particular distribution of price increases and price decreases. As such, the probability of ending up at a particular pricing outcome n periods after the start of the price series is given by the binomial formula.</p>

    <p>Suppose in Figure 2-A-14 the call option expires at time T<sub>1</sub>, which is 2 periods after the start. Using the binomial formula, the probability of obtaining price <span class="nobr">P<span class="supsub">3<br />3</span></span> is equal to 0.125. The payoff to the holder of the call if this price emerges is 2M. Thus, the expected payoff when the call expires at time T<sub>1</sub> is 0.25M. Now suppose the option expires at time T<sub>2</sub>, which is 4 periods after the start. Once again using the binomial formula, the probability of ending up with price <span class="nobr">P<span class="supsub">5<br />5</span></span> is equal to 0.03125, and the probability of ending up with price <span class="nobr">P<span class="supsub">5<br />4</span></span> is equal to 0.15625. In this case the expected payoff from the call is equal to (0.03125*4 + 0.15625*2)M, which reduces to 0.4375M. The expected payoff with a T<sub>2</sub> expiry is therefore significantly larger than the expected payoff with a T<sub>1</sub> expiry. The intuition for this result is similar to the intuition for the previous result concerning price volatility. In this case, with no limit on the upside and the maximum loss equal to the purchase price of the option the longer is the time horizon before expiry the greater the potential for a large payoff without the potential for an equal-sized offsetting loss.</p>

    </p>
        
    <p>The comparative static results that were illustrated in the previous section can be generalized by examining the theoretical relationship between the price of an option and the three parameters which define the option. The specific marginal relationships are named as follows: delta for the marginal impact of a higher futures price, vega for the marginal impact of higher volatility and theta for the marginal impact of a longer time until the option expires. These three marginal impacts, together with two additional marginal impacts which are not included in this analysis, are referred to as the Greeks. </p>

            <p><i>The "Greeks"</i> are a collection of individual variables which measure the sensitivity of the option's price to the parameters of the pricing formula: delta (underlying futures price), vega (futures price volatility) and theta (time until expiry). </p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Marginal Versus Average Impacts</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>The relationships between the price of the option and the parameters of the option contract can be also be observed on average. The average and marginal impacts are different in magnitude but have the same sign. For example, a positive value for delta, which implies that a marginally higher value futures price raises the price of the call option, is consistent with a positive average impact (i.e., the relationship between the futures price and the price of a call option is positive). In what follow both marginal and average values are examined.</p>
        
    <p>Numerical values for the marginal impacts as measured by the three Greek variables, and the average impacts, which can be inferred from set of option prices, are obtained from an option price calculator. The calculator can be built within an Excel worksheet using the mathematical equations which define the option prices and the "Greeks". These equations can be found in advanced textbooks or in the following June, 2013 blog post by <a href="https://www.glynholton.com/notes/black_1976/" target="_blank">Glyn Holton</a>. You will be asked to <a href="other_2a/option_pricing_model.xlsx">download</a> an option price calculator that was built by Professor Vercammen for use in Assignment 3.</p>

    <p> The CME website provides a Black (1976) option pricing <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/options-calculator.html" target="_blank">calculator </a> that allows the Greeks to be calculated along with the theoretical price of the option. An August 9, 2019 screen capture of the calculator for the case of a call option on December corn futures with a November, 2019 expiry and a 420 ($4.20/bu) strike price is illustrated in Figure 2-A-15. The calculator shows that the option's theoretical price of 22.43 ($0.2243/bu)is very close to the actual 23.45 ($0.2325) August 9th settle price. This outcome emerges because associated with the $0.2325 settle price is a level of implied volatility (VOL), and this imputed level of implied volatility is fed into the Black 1976 formula to generate the theoretical price of $0.2243/bu.</p>

    <p>In the three tables to follow the top half reports the theoretical prices of the option with alternative parameter assumptions and the bottom half reports the Greeks. In all three cases the strike price is fixed at 400 ($4.00/bu), the three columns correspond to an initial futures price set at 390, 400 and 410, and the three rows correspond to volatility set at 0.2. 0.3 and 0.4. For a call option, the left column implies out of the money, the middle column implies at the money and the right column implies in the money.</p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">The Option's Delta</font> </blockquote>
    </p>
        
    <p>An option's delta is a measure of how the price of the option responds to marginal changes in the underlying futures price. The option pricing impact from an increase in the initial futures price holding the strike price constant is similar, but not identical, to the option pricing impact from a decrease in the strike price holding the initial futures price constant. Thus, similar to the discussion concerning Figure 2-A-12, if the underlying futures price is relatively high such that the call is deep in the money then we should expect the price of the call option to move almost one-for-one with a marginal increase in the initial futures price. Conversely, if the underlying futures price is relatively low such that he call is deep out of the money then we should expect the price of the call to move very little with a marginal increase in the initial futures price. Similar types of changes should be expected when examining average impacts.</p>

    <p>The bottom half of Figure 2-A-16 reports the call option delta values for various combinations of the initial futures price and price volatility. As expected, the values are positive, and higher values of the underlying futures price correspond to higher values for delta. For example, when the expiry time is T = 40 weeks and the volatility is 0.3, the delta is 42 when the option is out of the money (a futures price equal to 390) and is 62 when the option is in the money (a futures price equal to 410). In the first case, a delta of 42 means that if the initial futures price increases from 390 to 391 (i.e., $0.01/bu), then the price of the call will increase by $0.0042/bu.</p>

    <p>The average impacts, which can inferred from the call prices that appear in the top half of Figure 2-A-16, are consistent with the properties of the delta values. For example, an increase in the underlying futures price from 390 to 410 results in an increase in the price of the call by approximately 10 units for the four alternative time horizons and the three alternative volatility settings.  </p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">The Option's Vega</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>The bottom of Figure 2-A-17 shows vega, which is how the price of the call is impacted by marginally higher volatility. For example, with an expiry date of T = 40 and a call option that is at the money (i.e., the futures price is 400), increasing volatility from 30 to 31 will increase the price of the call by 0.526, starting from a price of 15.81. Figure 2-A-17 shows that a marginal increase in volatility has its biggest impact on the price of the call when the call is at the money versus being either deep in or deep out of the money. As well, the vega value is larger for option contracts with longer time horizons. Notice that the size of vega changes very little in response to changes in the level of volatility.</p>

    <p>The prices in the top of Figure 2-A-17 are consistent with the marginal impacts as measured by Vega. Notice that the increase in the price of the call in response to higher futures price volatility (i.e., moving down a column) is relatively large. This outcome is expected given the results from the previous section where it was shown that simulated payoffs from a call option are much higher with higher levels of futures price volatility. Notice also from Figure 2-A-17 that the impact of higher volatility on the price of the call is larger for longer time horizons.</p>

            <blockquote><font size="4">The Option's Theta</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>The theta values in the bottom half of Figure 2-A-18 show how the price of the option changes with a one day reduction in the option's expiry time. The negative values imply that the time value of the option declines with a marginally shorter time until the expiry date. For example, with the expiry time set at T = 40 days, the initial futures price set equal to 400 and the volatility set equal to 0.3, the bottom half of Table 2-A-3 reveals that the price of the call option will decrease by 0.197 units relative to the call's starting price of 1581 given a one day reduction in the call's time horizon. Not surprisingly, the value of theta is smaller the longer the expiry time. As well, theta is significantly larger at higher levels of price volatility. </p>

    <p>The top half of Table 2-A-3 reveals that the average impacts of time are consistent with the marginal impacts which are measured by theta. For example, when the strike price is 400 and the level of volatility is 0.3, the price of the call increase by approximately 10 units for each additional 10 days in the length of the option's time horizon. As well, the impact of time on the price of the call is more pronounced for longer time horizons. </p>

    <ol start="5"> 
        <li>The payoff schedule for an option contract shows that if the futures price is above the strike price when the option expires then the call option _____ (will, will not) be exercised and the put option _____ (will, will not) be exercised. The writer of the option earns a ________ (negative, positive, zero) profit if the option expires out of the money. </li> 
        <br/>

        <li>The writer of a call option ________ (must take, has the option to take) a _______ (short, long) futures position at the option’s strike price when the option is exercised by whoever is currently holding the option. Writing a call option requires opening a margin account because the loss for the writer of a call can grow very large as the futures price _______ (increases above, decreases below) the option’s strike price. It is for this reason that the payoff schedule for the writer of the call option does not have any ________ (downward, upward) sloping segments.</li> 
        <br/>
          
        <li>The payoff schedule for the person holding a put contract crosses the horizontal axis when the futures price is equal to the _______ (strike price, strike price minus the price of the put).  The upside profit potential is not subject to a maximum value for the case of the _____ (call, put) contract and is subject to a maximum value for the case of the _____ (call, put) contract. </li> 
        <br/>

        <li>If the payoff schedule for a put and option with the same strike price and same December futures contract are placed on the same graph, then the position is called a _______ (straddle, strangle). Unlike a put or call, the holder of the straddle makes money with a sufficiently large  _______ (increase, decrease, either increase or decrease) in the futures price. A straddle will have the highest value when futures prices have a ______ (low, high) level of price volatility. </li>

    <ol start="9"> 
         
        <li>
            <p>The simulated prices in Figures 2-A-12 and 2-A-13 allow us to:</p>
            
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Examine the cost of buying a put or call option in the first week of trading (i.e., week 38 of 2019). </li>
                <li>Determine if the option's pay out in the final week has zero value or a positive value.</li>
                <li>Estimate the time value of the option.</li>
                <li>Optimize the strike price.</li>

        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Figures 2-A-12 and 2-A-13 help you think about the connection between the selling price of the option (e.g., $0.25/bu for a put) and the underlying futures price, the expiry date of the contract and futures price volatility. Factors that raise the expected payout also raise the selling price for the option. The expected payout depends on both the difference between the futures price and the strike price when the option expires, and the probability that the option will expire in the money. In Figure 2-A-12:</p>
            
            <ol type="a">
                <li>A call option with a strike price of S0 finishes in the money 3 out of 10 times. </li>
                <li>A put option with a strike price of S1 finishes in the money 2 out of 10 times.</li>
                <li>Both (a) and (b).</li>
                <li>None of the above.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>A comparison of Figures 2-A-12 and 2-A-13 reveals that if a put or a call option with a strike price of S0 is in the money when the contract expires then the average size of the payoff:</p>
            
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Is higher in Figure 2-A-12 due to the higher level of price volatility. </li>
                <li>Is higher in Figure 2-A-13 due to the lower level of price volatility.</li>
                <li>Does not appear to be related to the level of price volatility.</li>
                <li>Is zero in both Figure 2-A-12 and 2-A-13.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Suppose in Figure 2-A-13 that the option expired in Week 46 of year 2020 rather than Week 49, of year 2021. The shorter time horizon:</p>
            
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Increases the number of times a call option with a S0 strike finishes in the money. </li>
                <li>Increases the number of times that a put option with a S0 strike finishes in the money.</li>
                <li>Both (a) and (b).</li>
                <li>None of the above.</li>

        <li> In Figure 2-A-14 the probability that the futures price is P<sub>3</sub><sup>3</sup> at time T1 is equal to _______ (0.125, 0.25, 0.50). This value was calculated with the binomial formula where the probability of success is 0.5, the number of trials is _____ (one, two, three) and the number of successes is _____ (one, two, three).</li>

        <br/>
        <li>Figure 2-A-15 is a screen capture of the CME’s option price calculator. The price of the call option with a 420 strike price was generated on August 9, 2019, which is about 104 days before the option expires. On this day corn futures settled at 417.25 and corn options settle at ______ (23.25, 22.43, 26.79). The market’s estimate of price volatility on August 9, 2019 is ____ (23.25, 22.43, 26.79). When this level of price volatility is fed into the Black (1976) formula than the calculated price of the option is ______ (23.25, 22.43, 26.79).</li>

        <br/>
        <li> The bottom half of Figure 2-A-16 shows the delta for a call option with a 400 strike price. When there are T = 40 weeks until expiry and volatility is 0.3 then the delta is equal to  _____ (42, 52, 62). With this value of delta, a one cent increase in the futures price results in a ______ (42, 0.42, 0.042) cent increase in the price of the call option. The deeper the call option is into the money the _____ (lower, higher) the delta of the option.</li>

        <br/>
        <li>The bottom half of Figure 2.A.17 shows the vega of the call option. The results clearly demonstrate that a more volatile futures price results in a _______(lower, higher) value for the call option. For example, with T = 40 days until the option expires, raising volatility from 0.3 to 0.31 increases the price of the call by _____ (0.526, 5.26, 52.5) cents per liter. This increase is approximately 3 percent of the price of the call, which is equal to ______ (10.55, 15.81, 21.08).</li>
