    </ul>
        
    
    <p>In this module three remaining topics that relate to commodity options are examined. The first section on option pricing methods is the most important because the method of pricing via risk-free portfolio creation is used extensively in the general finance literature. The second section on implied volatility and volatility smiles is important for real-world applications of option pricing. The last section on hedging with options and swaps shows how these two instruments can be used instead of futures positions when hedging spot market positions in commodity markets. The U.S. corn market is once again the focus of this analysis.</p>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a001"></a>(i) Option Pricing Methods</h3>

    <p>In Module 2-A the theoretical prices of call and put options that can be generated using the Black (1976) pricing formula were used as part of a general sensitivity analysis. In this first section of Module 2-B we examine how the Black (1976) pricing model works. The general idea is that a portfolio which includes a call option is created, and the mix of instruments is chosen in a way that makes the portfolio risk free. Arbitrage ensures the return on such a portfolio is the risk free rate, and this allows the price of the call option to be pinned down. The price of the put option can then be recovered. Rather than delving into the messy mathematics of the Black (1976) model we will instead construct the risk free portfolio using the much simpler binomial pricing model. It is important to keep in mind when pricing options either with Black (1976) or the binomial model that all of the relevant information about the market fundamentals is incorporated into the futures price. As such, the information that is used to price a call or put options is limited to beliefs about the stochastic process which governs the futures price over time (e.g., beliefs about future volatility). Depending on the dispersion of beliefs about future volatility, the spread between the bid and ask prices is often quite small in the options market because prices are determined via a formula rather than subjective beliefs about market fundamentals.  </p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Put - Call Parity</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>The method of risk-free, zero arbitrage pricing is well illustrated by deriving the theoretical relationship between the price of a put option and the price of call option assuming that the put and call have the same strike price and expiry date. Under these conditions, the formula which shows the price of a put option as a function of the price of a call option is referred to as <i>put-call parity</i>.</p>
    <br/>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 700px; background-color: #0404B4;">

            <p>Put - call parity is the theoretical relationship that connects the price of a put option and the price of a call option, assuming that both options have the same strike price and expiry date. </p> 
            <p>Put - call parity does not rely on assumptions about the stochastic process which governs the underlying futures price. </p> 
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The first step in deriving the put - call parity relationship is based on the widely-used assumption that all zero-risk commodity portfolios should earn the risk free rate of return. If a risk free portfolio earned a return that is higher than the rate of interest on riskless government bonds then arbitrage will take place. Specifically, investors would replace their position in the government bond market with a position in the commodity portfolio in order to earn a higher return. The demand for the commodity portfolio across a large number of investors will drive up the price of the portfolio until the return that is earned on the portfolio is equal to the riskless rate.</p>

    <p> Suppose at date t a trader takes the following positions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A long position in the futures market</li>
        <li>Purchase a put option at strike price K</li>
        <li>Sell/write a call option at strike price K</li>
    </ul>
            
    <p>At date T, when both option contracts expire, the trader:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Offsets her long position in the futures market</li>
        <li>Exercises her put option if F<sub>T</sub> < K</li> 
        <li>Pays her obligation as a seller of a call option, which is F<sub>T</sub> – K, if F<sub>T</sub> > K</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The above investment strategy results in the following cash flow when the portfolio is created at date t and dismantled at date T.</p>

    <p>FIGURE 2-B-1: Date t and Date T Cash Flow for Put - Call Parity
    </div>

    <p>Figure 2-B-1 shows that the date t cash flow is the sale of the call minus the purchase of the put, C(t) - P(t). Moreover, the date T cash flow is equal to the strike price minus the date t futures price, K - F(t), regardless of the value of the date T futures price. Thus, a risk free portfolio has been created and arbitrage will ensure that those who hold this portfolio will earn the riskless rate, r. To incorporate this restriction begin by noting that an alternative way to earn a cash flow equal to K - F(t) at date T is to invest at date t an amount [K - F(t)]e<sup>-r(T-t)</sup> in a risk free savings account that pays interest at rate r. Doing this results in a date t cash flow equal to -[K - F(t)]e<sup>-r(T-t)</sup>. Arbitrage ensures that the two alternative ways to generate a date T cash flow equal to K - F(t) must be the same. Thus, it must be the case that -[K - F(t)]e<sup>-r(T-t)</sup> = C(t) - P(t). This equation can be rearranged to give the following formula for the put - call parity relationship.</p>

    <p>The CME option pricing <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/options-calculator.html" target="_blank">calculator</a> 
    can be used to demonstrate that the put - call parity relationship holds. FIGURE 2-B-2 shows the calculated option prices assuming a riskless rate of 2 percent, a strike price of 400 ($4.00/bu), two alternative values for the initial futures price (390 and 410) and two alternative values for futures price volatility (20 percent and 30 percent). Figure 2-B-3 contains the set of calculated put and call prices from Figure 2-B-2 together with the corresponding initial futures price, F(t), strike price, K, and riskless interest rate, r. If this data is plugged into the left hand side (LFS) and right hand side (RHS) of the put - call parity equation (see above), the results which appear are given by the two columns on the right of Figure 2-B-3. The fact that LHS = RHS for the various parameter combinations confirms the put - call parity relationship for this particular sample of data.</p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">One Period Binomial Model</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>The method of creating a riskless portfolio that underlies the derivation of the put - call parity relationship can also be used to price a call option in a simple one period binomial model. This analysis begins by assuming that the initial futures price, F<sub>0</sub>, will go up to F<sub>0</sub>u  with probability p, or will go down to F<sub>0</sub>d with probability 1 - p. An expression for the p parameter is shown below. Expressions for the u and d parameters are given by</p>

    <br/>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 700px; background-color: #0404B4;">
        <div style="position: relative; top: -10px; left: -10px; padding: 10px; background: #CCFFFF; border: 2px solid #0404B4;">
            <p>u = e<sup>&sigma;&radic;t</sup> and d = e<sup>-&sigma;&radic;t</sup> where &sigma; = annualized volatility and t = time (in years)  </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>To calibrate this simple binomial model let &Delta; denote the number of years until the option expires. Assume the option will expire in 32 days and so &Delta; = 32/252 = 0.127 years (there are 252 trading days in a year). Annualized volatility is assumed to be 20 percent, which implies &sigma; = 0.2. Using the previous formulas we have u = 1.0739 and d = 0.9312. Thus, the futures price will rise from F(t) = 4 to F(T) = 4*1.0739 = 4.30 with probability p, and will fall from F(t) = 4 to F(T) = 4*0.09312 = 3.72 with probability 1 - p.</p>

    <p>The goal is to price a call option with a strike price K where K lies between 3.72 and 4.30. As with the put - call parity relationship, the starting point is ensuring that the date T value of the investor's portfolio is independent of the F(T) futures price outcome. Figure 2-B-4 shows the calculations. At date t, which is when the option is being priced, the investor takes a H-unit long position in the futures market at the prevailing price of 4.00, and at the same time sells one call option with a strike price of K. At date T the long position is offset with a short position and this generates a return in the futures market equal to [F(T) - F(t)]H. If the date T futures price ends up being low, F(T) = 3.72, then the call is not exercised and the investor who has written the call at date t has no payment to make. In the opposite case where the futures price ends up being high, F(T) = 4.30, the call is exercised and the investor must pay the holder of the option an amount equal to 4.3 - K. If this cost of honouring the call is subtracted from the gain in the futures market then the resulting value is the investor's cash flow, which is reported in the bottom row of Table 2-B-2.

    </div>

    <p>Let's check to ensure that the Delta hedge is working properly. Separately substitute the expression for H<sup>*</sup> into each side of the boxed equation above confirms the equality:</p>

        </div>
    </div>
     
    <p>We have shown that committing to H<sup>*</sup> units of long futures and selling one call option ensures that the date T payoff is risk free at level -0.4828(4.3 - K). An alternative way to generate this same date T payoff is to borrow 0.4828(4.3 - K)/(1 + &Delta;r) at date t and repay this amount with interest at the risk free annual rate r. Given that the date T risk free cash flow with the borrowing strategy is equal to the date T risk free cash flow with the portfolio strategy it follows from the no arbitrage argument that the date t cash inflow for each strategy must be the same. The cash inflow for the portfolio strategy is C<sub>0</sub> because this is the amount received when the call option was sold. The cash inflow from the borrowing strategy is 0.4828(4.3 - K)/(1 + &Delta;r). Thus, no arbitrage requires: </p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p> After plugging in relevant values for K and r, the above equation shows the theoretically accurate price for the call option. The price of the put option can be obtained using the price of the call option and the formula for the put - call parity relationship.</p>

        <hr align="left" width="50%">
        <blockquote><font size="4">Risk Neutral Probabilities</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>If we knew the value for p, which is the probability that the futures price will increase, then we could calculate the price of the call option more directly. Indeed, the call generates a date T payoff equal to 4.3 – K with probability p, and generates a date T payoff equal to zero with probability 1 – p. The expected payoff is therefore p(4.3 – K) + (1 – p)*0. Accounting for the cost of capital that is tied up in the call it follows that C<sub>0</sub> = p(4.3 – K)/(1 + &Delta;r). Unfortunately, without knowing the value of p it is not possible to calculate a specific value for the price of the call option.</p>
        
    <p>However, before giving up on this direct approach we should recognize that the the price of the call obtained from the direct method must be equal to the price of the call obtained from the portfolio method, which was C0 = 0.4828(4.3 – K)/(1 + &Delta;r). Setting the two expressions equal to each other gives:  p(4.3 – K)/(1 + &Delta;r) = 0.4828(4.3 – K)/(1 + &Delta;r). Solve this expression for p to obtain the desired probability: p<sup>*</sup> = 0.4828.</p>

    <p>The p<sup>*</sup> expression is referred to as the risk neutral probability. This expression can be used to calculate the expected futures price at date T. Specifically, E(F<sub>T</sub>) = 4.3p<sup>*</sup> + 3.7(1 - p<sup>*</sup>). After substituting in p<sup>*</sup> = 0.4828 it follows that E(F<sub>T</sub>) = 4. This result shows that the expected date T futures price is equal to the date t futures price. In other words, the futures price is not expected to increase or decrease over time, which is the result we expect given the assumption of normal price expectations and the analysis that was conducted in module 1.</p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Valuing American Style Options</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p> An American style call or put option can be exercised any time prior to the option's expiry date. This added flexibility raises the price of an American style option relative to a European style option. The problem is that there is no direct way to value an American style option. A common way to obtain a numerical estimate is to use a binomial lattice model. A simplified version of this method will be described in this section. The goal is to replicate the results of an example that is published on the <a href="http://investexcel.net/binomial-tree-american-option/" target="_blank">Invest Excel</a> website.</p>

    <p>Suppose the futures price is initially F<sub>0</sub> = 50. In each of five periods the futures price will be scaled up by a factor u = 1.1198 or scaled down by a factor d = 1/1.1198 = 0.893. Scaling up (down) occurs with probability p = 0.5072 (p = 0.4928). These particular values where chosen to ensure that price volatility is 40 percent. Each period lasts one month, and the risk free rate of interest is 0.008 per month. The goal is to value an American put that is currently in the money with a strike price of 55. The <i>Invest Excel</i> website shows that the initial value of the put is 7.02. Given that the initial intrinsic value of the put if 55 - 50 = 5, it follows that the initial time value of the put is 7.02 - 5 = 2.02. What follows is the steps that are needed to calculate this value.</p>

    <p>Figure 2-B-5 shows the possible pathways for the futures price over the five periods (these prices are highlighted in yellow). If the put option has not been exercised prior to reaching period 5 then in period 5 it will be exercised only if the prevailing futures price is below the strike price (set equal to 55). The payoff is zero when the put is not exercised (top three branches in period 5) and the payoff is equal to the strike price minus the futures price when the put is exercised (bottom three branches in period 5). Now move one node to the left to examine the value of the put in period 4. The put's value is the maximum of the value of the put if it is exercised immediately and the value of the put if the decision is delayed by one period. The bottom cell in the second last column of Figure 2-B-5 shows a sample calculation. In this case the futures price is 31.80 and so exercising the put immediately will generate a payoff equal to 55 - 31.80 = 23.20. If instead the decision is delayed then with probability p the price will rise from 31.80 to 35.61, in which case the put will be exercised and will generate a payoff equal to 19.39, and with probability 1 - p the price will fall from 31.80 to 28.39, in which case the put will be exercised and will generate a payoff equal to 26.61. The expected payoff from delaying the decision, discounted by one month, is shown to equal 22.86. This value is less than the value of the put if it is exercised immediately (i.e., 22.86 < 23.20) and so the put will be exercised, and its valuation is 23.30. This same procedure is applied to the remaining nodes in period 4. Figure 2-B-5 shows that exercising the put immediately in period 4 is optimal for the bottom two nodes (shaded orange), and delay is optimal for the top three nodes (shaded turquois).</p>

    </div>

    <p>The method of valuing each node for periods 1 through 3 is the same as that described for period 4. Notice that in periods 1 and 2 delaying the decision is always optimal. This is because the futures price is not yet sufficiently deep in the money to consider exercising the put. The period 0 value of the put confirms the 7.02 calculated value that appears in the <i>Invest Excel</i> webpage. As a point of comparison the value of an European put is calculated in the cell below the period 0 node. The value of the European put makes use of the binomial probabilities which appear to the right of the period 5 futures prices as well as the corresponding values of the period 5 puts. The expected value of the period 5 payoff is discounted by five periods to arrive at the 6.59 period 0 value of the European put. The difference in the price of the American and European puts (7.02 - 6.59 = 0.43) is due to the extra flexibility that is associated with the American put.</p>

    <p>By now it should be clear that the level of volatility in the futures price, as measured by &sigma;, is an important determinant of the prices of the call and put options. This relationship is made clear in the Black (1976) formula for pricing a call on a futures contract, as is illustrated in Figure 2-B-6 In principle, the formula in Figure 2-B-6 can be inverted so that the volatility parameter, &sigma;, is a function of the price of the call, C<sub>0</sub>. If the settle price of the call from the CME website is inserted into this inverted formula then the resulting value is an estimate of traders' average beliefs about price volatility. This calculation is routinely performed and it is referred to as <i> implied volatility</i></p>

        </div>

    <p>At a given point in time, when the implied volatility calculation is made for option contracts with different strike prices and different days until maturity the implied value of &sigma; is often quite different. This is not suppose to be the case because at a given point in time price volatility should be the same for different contract configurations. One explanation is that the demand for out of the money puts and calls is higher when the option is more out of the money. This higher demand bids up the price of the option contract, which results in a higher level of implied volatility. A second popular explanation is that the settle prices that are generated are not fully consistent with the Black (1976) formula. This would be the case if trading professionals make explicit or implicit adjustments to the prices that are generated by the Black (1976) formula. Adjustments are made because real-world futures price distributions often have fatter tails than the log normal price distribution, which underlies the Black (1976) formula. According to the economics section of the Wikipedia entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-tailed_distribution" target="_blank">Fat-tailed distributions</a>, asset prices often have fat tails since extreme events such as major stock market crashes occur at a frequency which is much higher than that implied by the normal and log normal price distributions.</p>

    <p>If traders believe that actual asset prices have fatter tails than that which is assumed by the Black (1976) formula then these traders will artificially increase the value of &sigma; in the Black (1976) formula when calculating the value of a call or put option. If this type of adjustment is not made when calculating implied volatility then the estimate of &sigma; will be higher when the adjustment is made versus not made. The differences in the calculated implied volatility for different strike prices and expiry dates therefore reflect differences in the level of adjustments that traders are making to account for fat tails. Fat tails are particularly important for calls and puts that are deep out of the money because these options are associated with long shot events. A graph of how the implied volatility estimate of &sigma; changes as the option becomes more and more out of the money typically takes on the appearance of a "smile". Real world traders are particularly interested in the volatility smile because it reveals what traders as a group are thinking about the presence of fat tails in the distribution of futures prices.  </p> 

    <p>Figure 2-B-7 shows a volatility smile for corn puts and calls as of August 19, 2019. The graph was generated by first downloading the set of put and call prices from the CME website. For strike prices below the August 19, 2019 futures settle price of $3.75/bu, the put prices were inserted into the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/options-calculator.html" target="_blank">CME Option Calculator</a> and the associated set of implied volatility values that were returned by the calculator were set aside. The procedure for calculating implied volatility for strike prices above the futures settle price was repeated but this time for calls. The full set of implied volatility values were then graphed against their strike prices. The volatility smile in Figure 2-B-7 is reasonably pronounced. The smile is also a bit lopsided, with larger volatility differences for the call versus the put. This latter result possibly suggests that traders are more worried about a long shot event that will cause the price of corn to spike upward (e.g., a severe drought in many countries simultaneously) versus a long shot event that will cause the price of corn to surge down due to oversupply or a global recession.</p>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a003"></a>(iii) Hedging with Options and Swaps</h3>

    <p>This final section of Module 2-B is devoted to hedging with options and commodity swaps. Each is discussed in turn.</p>
    
    <p>
        <hr align="left" width="50%">
        <blockquote><font size="4">Hedging with Options</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>Hedging with option contracts rather than futures contracts is very popular in agricultural markets. An important advantage is that an option contract can be much better customized to the risk preferences of the manager as compared to a futures contract. A second important advantage is that unlike a futures contract, there are no margin calls to cover when hedging with an option contract. If the option is purchased quite deep out of the money then hedging with an option contract is similar to purchasing price insurance with a high deductible. This is a desirable risk management strategy for managers who are able to absorb a higher level of risk because the low cost of purchasing the option allows for high returns when price moves in a favourable direction. At the opposite extreme, if the option is purchased moderately deep in the money then the price of the option will tend to be strongly negatively correlated with the spot price, and a traditional hedging outcome is achieved.</p>

    <p>Recall that if a manager exercises a put option then she is given a short futures position at the strike price that is attached to the option. The short position is normally immediately offset, which means that the payoff to the put option is the strike price minus the futures price. Assuming a strong positive correlation between the futures price and the spot price (i.e., low basis variability) and a put contract that is in the money, it follows that higher losses in the spot market are partially offset by a higher payoff to the put option. This means that purchasing a put option protects against downside price risk. For opposite reasons, purchasing a call option protects again upside price risk. This leads to the following characterization of hedging with option contracts. </p>

    <p>Suppose it is August 5, 2019 and a firm in Illinois wishes to protect against an unexpected drop in the spot price of the corn that it owns. The firm knows that prior to the start of trading on Monday, August 12th the USDA will release a crop report, and the report will comment on the size of the domestic and global corn stockpile. If the corn stocks come in larger than expected then prices will surge downward during Monday's trading. Conversely, if stocks are smaller than expected then prices will surge upward. The firm can take a short futures position to hedge but prefers to use a put option in order to benefit from the price upswing if the crop report announces lower stocks than expected. Figure 2-B-8 shows that the announced level of corn stocks was larger than expected and corn prices dropped "limit down", as described in a <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/videos/2019/08/august-12-grains-commentary-virginia-mcgathey.html" target="_blank">USDA Crop Report Commentary</a>. The set of futures and spot prices for several days prior to the announcement (August 5 - 9th) and after the announcement (August 12 - 15th) are shown in Figure 2-B-8.</p>

        <p>FIGURE 2-B-8: Corn Futures and Spot Prices: August 5 - August 15, 2019
    </div>

    <p>Figure 2-B-8 reveals that the spot price and futures price tracked very closely over the August 5 - 15th period. For this reason the role of basis risk as a determinant of hedging effectiveness is not important in this particular scenario. Figure 2-B-9 shows the drop in the futures price and the drop in the set of put prices between when the hedge was initiated with the purchase of a put on August 5th and when the hedge was lifted with the sale of the put on August 14th. The various columns correspond to different strike prices for the put option, which range from $3.30/bu to $4.40/bu. The columns with an "IM" label indicate that the associated put is in the money. Recall from Section (iii) of Module 2-A that the delta measure of an option contract measures how the price of the option changes with respect to a change in the underlying futures price. Consistent with the theory, Figure 2-B-9 clearly shows that the delta of the put contract is an increasing function of the strike price or the "moneyness" of the option. It should be clear from Figure 2-B-9 that knowing the delta of the option is important for knowing the hedging effectiveness of the put contract. </p>

    <p>When hedging with a put contract if the basis is fixed over time then the strike price minus the cost of the put when the hedge is initiated plus the basis serves as a floor price in the spot market. To understand why this is the case, let S<sub>Floor</sub> denote the floor price and PMT<sub>1</sub> denote the net payment received when the put is exercised as part of lifting the hedge (assuming the put is in the money). Also, let F<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> denote the futures price and spot price, respectively, when the hedge is lifted. Finally, let B denote the fixed basis, K denote the put's strike price and P<sub>0</sub> the price of the put when the hedge is initiated. The claim is that S<sub>Floor</sub> = K - P<sub>0</sub> + B and PMT<sub>1</sub> = S<sub>Floor</sub> - S<sub>1</sub> for all S<sub>1</sub> &les; S<sub>Floor</sub>. To prove that this claim is correct, combine these two expressions with F<sub>1</sub>  substituting for S<sub>1</sub> - B to get PMT<sub>1</sub> = K - F<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>0</sub>. This last expression must be true because K - F<sub>1</sub> is the payoff when the put is exercised and so K - F<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>0</sub> is the net payment received. </p>

                <p>When hedging with a put, the strike price minus the cost of the put plus the basis (assumed fixed) is the floor price in the spot market.   </p>
        </div>
    </div>
        
    <p>Suppose on August 5th the firm desires a relatively high floor spot price of $4.10/bu, which is about 5 percent below the $4.33/bu spot price on August 5th. Noting that the basis in this market is approximately $0.17/bu, in order to achieve this floor price the firm chooses a put with a strike price of $4.20 and an August 5th cost of $0.27/bu (see Figure 2-B-9). This put is slightly in the money because the August 5th futures price is $4.15. To see why a $4.20 strike implies a $4.10 floor price apply the above formula: S<sub>Floor</sub> = 4.20 - 0.27 + 0.17 = 4.10.</p> 
    
    <p> When the hedge is lifted on August 14th the put is deeper in the money because the futures price has sunk to $3.70/bu and the price of the put has risen to $0.54/bu. The firm must decide whether to sell the put for $0.54/bu, or to exercise the put. If the put is exercised the firm is given a short futures position at the $4.20/bu strike price. This position is immediately offset with a long position at the August 14th futures price of $3.70/bu for a net gain of $0.50/bu. Selling the put is slightly more profitable ($0.04/bu) due to remaining time value. Consequently, the net gain on the put transaction is the $0.54/bu selling price minus the $0.27/bu purchase price, which implies a net gain of $0.27/bu.</p>

        <p>FIGURE 2-B-9: Corn Futures and Option Prices: August 5 and August 14, 2019
    </div>
            
    <p>The $0.27/bu gain on the put transaction is considerably less than the decrease in the spot price, which is approximately equal to the 4.33 - 3.70 = $0.63/bu decrease in the futures price. As compared to a short futures, the put is only partially effective at protecting against the downside price risk. This is because if the crop report had been opposite and the price had surged upward instead of downward, then the put contract would allow the firm to pocket the upside price surge dollar for dollar. AS Figure 2-B-9 shows, if the firm had instead chosen an out of the money put with a strike price of $3.60/bu and an up front cost of $0.028/bu then the lower effectiveness of the option as a hedge as compared to a short futures as a hedge is even more striking. In this case the floor price in the spot market is much lower at approximately 3.60 - 0.03 + 0.17 = $3.80/bu. When the hedge is lifted on August 14th the put will be sold for $0.11/bu for a gain of $0.08/bu. This is much smaller than the approximate $0.63/bu drop in the spot price. This inexpensive out of the money put would be chosen if on August 5th the firm wanted a large exposure to the upside price swing in the event the crop report announced lower than expected stocks, and the firm was okay with operating with the comparatively low $3.80/bu floor spot price.</p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Commodity Swaps</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>Swaps are customized risk-management derivative instruments which trade over-the-counter (OTC) rather than in a centralized exchange. A typical OTC transaction may involve an institutional dealer (e.g., a large bank) swapping with an ethanol producer the monthly variable (risky) corn input prices for a sequence of fixed (no-risk) monthly payments. The size of the transaction, the frequency of the payment (e.g., weekly versus monthly) and the duration of the swap contract can be tailored to the individual client. Other types of swaps include interest rate swaps and currency swaps. The daily trade in commodity swaps, such as those used by ethanol producers, are particularly important in the crude oil market, but this volume is small in comparison to currency and interest rate swaps. Indeed, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cftc-swaps/us-regulator-seeks-to-set-the-record-straight-on-size-of-swaps-market-idUSKBN1FL5T0" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, interest rate swaps are currently valued at approximately $15 trillion USD, which is much larger than the futures and options market for interest rates.</p>

    <p>An important limitation of a swap transaction is counterparty risk. Unlike a futures market which utilizes margin deposits that are managed by a clearing house, there is no standardized method for ensuring that parties to the swap transaction make payments according to the swap contract. Neutral third parties can be contracted to hold and manage performance bonds but this extra layer is often expensive. The <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/files/centrally-cleared-ag-swaps-brochure.pdf" target="_blank">CME</a> addresses this problem by serving as a low-cost neutral third party for swaps involving CME commodities such as corn. </p>

    <p>The simulation model that was featured in Module 1 can be used here to explain how a swap works. The scenario considered is the one for which there is a year stockout due to the relatively low level of potential production loss in year 2. The swap arrangement is assumed to begin at the end of quarter 4, which is the end of the non-stochastic marketing year. Cells B6:C9 in Figure 2-B-10 show the set of prices for quarters 5 through 8 for the two alternative scenarios of normal and low year 2 harvest levels. The ethanol producer wishes to hedge against the possibility of high corn prices in quarters 5 through 8 due to a low year 2 harvest. Rather than using a sequence of short futures contracts or put options, the ethanol producer negotiates a swap contract with a large bank and the transaction is managed by the CME.</p>

    <p>The swap contract specifies a reference price, such as $3.50/bu, which shows up in cell B1 in Figure 2-B-10. The value chosen for this reference price is not important but it should be chosen less than the lowest possible price to ensure that the variable payments from the swap dealer to the ethanol producer are non-negative. Cells D6:E9 show the payments that the swap dealer makes to the ethanol producer each quarter under the two alternative pricing outcomes. The payment is the price outcome minus the reference price (e.g., 3.562 - 3.500 = 0.062 for the case of a normal price in Q5). Accounting for the fact that each pricing outcome is equally likely, cells F6:F9 show the payments the swap dealer expects to make to the ethanol producer. Assuming an 8 percent annual discount rate, the quarterly discount factor is shown in cells G6:G9 and the discounted expected payments are shown in cells H6:H9. The net present value of the stream of expected payments, which is the sum of the values in cells H6:H9, appears as 1.173 in cell F1.</p>

        <p>FIGURE 2-B-10: An Example of a Swap in the Ethanol/Corn Market
    </div>

    <p>It is now possible to calculate the fixed payments that the ethanol producer provides to the swap dealer each quarter. The goal is to find the size of the quarterly payment such that the NPV of the four payments is the same as the NPV of the variable payments that the swap dealer makes to the ethanol producer. This is equivalent to finding an annuity with a predetermined present value. Excel's PMT() function is well suited to doing this calculation: =-PMT(0.02, 4, 1.173). The resulting payment is $0.31/bu as is shown in cell F2 in Figure 2-B-10. Cells I6:J9 show the net price that the ethanol producer pays for corn each quarter under the two alternative pricing scenarios. The net price is the market prices plus the fixed annuity payment minus the payment received from the swap dealer. As is expected, the swap has eliminated all price risk facing the ethanol producer because the net price is equal to $3.808/bu regardless of whether the market price of corn is normal or high. This net price depends on the discount rate but it does not depend on the reference price.</p>

    <li><p>The course notes show the risk free portfolio procedure for pricing a call option with the assumption that the futures price is currently $4.00 and it will either jump up to $4.30 or drop down to $3.72. The solution can be expressed as C<sub>0</sub> = 0.4828(4.3 - K)/(1 + &Delta;r).  </p> 
        
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Use the risk free pricing procedure to derive the price of a put option as a function of the strike price, K, and the time-adjusted discount rate, &Delta;r. Verify that your answer is correct using the formula for put - call parity. </li>
            <li>Use the risk free pricing procedure to derive the price of a call option with the assumption that the three prices are spot prices, and the call option is sold over the counter rather than within the CME. In this case, rather than going long futures and later offsetting, the trader buys corn at date t and sells it at date T. Similarly, exercising the call is equivalent to buying the corn at the strike price. The price of the call will be the same as that shown in the notes except now you must account for the impact of the corn purchase on the date t cash flow. As well, you must account for the $0.10/bu physical cost of storage which must be pre-paid at date t. </li>

    <li><p>Figure 2-B-5 shows the binomial tree method of pricing an American put option. Download the Excel version of Figure 2-B-5 by clicking <a href="other_2b/american_option.xlsx">here</a>. Study the model carefully to ensure that you understand the formulas in the various cells. Copy the worksheet so that you have an identical copy of the worksheet in the open workbook. In this new worksheet adjust the formulas in a way that allows you to price a call rather than a put. Be sure to adjust the colour scheme: a turquois shaded cell indicates that waiting/non-exercising is optimal, and a gold shaded cell indicates that immediately excercising the option is optimal.  </p>

    <li><p>The table below shows the set of Black (1976) call and put prices for various strike prices assuming futures are currently trading at $4.00 bu, the option expires in 60 days and the risk free rate of interest is 2 percent. The table also shows actual market prices for the calls and puts. These market prices are higher than the Black (1976) prices because traders are incuding a "fudge factor" to account for fat tails of the distribution of the corn futures price. Notice that the fudge factor gets larger as a proportion of the option price as the option moves deeper out of the money and thus deeper into the tails of the price distribution.   </p> 
        
        <ol type="a">
            <li>If you constructed a graph with the strike price on the horizontal axis and the implied volatility (IV) on the vertical axis, what would the graph look like if you are calculating the IV with the Black (1976) prices rather than the market prices? Briefly explain.</li>
            <li>Calibrate the CME option pricing calculator using the parameters shown above. Be sure to use the "Model" option in the top row to select the Black (1976) model. Calculate a set of IV values using the market prices for the calls and puts from the table below (it is okay to do the calculations on every second value). Graph these IV values with the stike price on the horizontal axis and implied volatility on the vertical axis.</li>

        <li>The orange schedule corresponds to a _____ (call option, put option) with a strike price of ______ (3.90, 3.95, 4.00). The red schedule corresponds to a _____ (call option, put option) with a strike price of ______ (3.90, 3.95, 4.00). The blue schedule corresponds to a ____ (short, long) futures contract with a date t price equal to ____ (3.90, 3.95, 4.00). </li>
        
        <br/>
       
        <li>If the three payoff schedules are vertically summed, the new (net) payoff schedule is (downward sloping, upward sloping, flat). Assuming e<sup>r(T – t)</sup> = 1.02, if B dollars is invested/borrowed at date t at the riskless rate r, and the future value of that investment matches the date T payoff of the futures/options portfolio (see previous question), then B must equal ______.</li> 

        <br/>

        <li><p>Which of the following statements is true? B can be interpreted as the date t:</p>

            <ol type="a">
                    <li>Price of the call minus the price of the put. </li>
                    <li>Price of the put minus the price of the call.</li>
                    <li>Price of the call minus the price of the put plus the price of the long futures contract.</li>
                    <li>Price of the put minus the price of the call plus the price of the long futures contract.</li>
                </ol>   
        </li> 

        <p><b>Pricing Options</b></p>

        <p>Suppose the date t futures price for corn is $4.00/bu. Moving from date t to date T, the corn price will either move up by a factor u or move down by a factor d. Option contracts written on this futures price have a strike price of 4.05.</p>
        <br/>
        <li> If σ = 0.2 and T – t = 0.4 years then F(t)u is equal to ____ and F(t)d is equal to _____. To create a delta hedge at date t, a trader will take a ____ (short, long) futures position for H bushels of corn, and will _____ (buy, sell) a _____ (put, call) option (the strike price is 4.05).</li>
        <br/>
        <li>The date T payoff is defined as the cash flow that results when the date t H bushel futures contract is offset, and any options which are in the money are exercised. The value of H which makes the date T cash flow risk free is equal to _____. With the optimal value of H in place at time t, the date T risk free payoff is equal to _____.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>The present value of the date T risk free payoff from the previous question is equal to ____ (divide by Δr = 1 + r(T – T) = 1.025 rather than assuming continuous compounding). Using this value the equilibrium price of a date t call option with a 4.05 strike is equal to ____. The corresponding price for the put is equal to _____.

        </li>
    </ol>
        
    <p><b>Risk Neutral Probabilities (based on previous set of questions)</b></p>

    <ol start="7"> 
        <li>Starting with a $4.00 futures price at date t, suppose the expected futures price at date T is also equal to $4.00. This assumption implies that the probability that the $4.00 futures price will move up is equal to _______.  </li> 
        <br/>

        <li>The expected payout of the call option is the probability that the futures price will increase multiplied by the payout from the call when the futures price does increase. In this particular case the expected payout is _____. The date t present value of the expected payout, once again using Δr = 1 + r(T – T) = 1.025 to discount, is equal to _______. Using this method, the date t risk neutral price of the call is ____. The call price derived using this method is _____ (less than, equal to, greater than) the call price derived using the conventional method. </li>

    <h5><i>Answer the following questions and be prepared to answer very similar questions during the in-class Canvas quiz:</i></h5>

    <p>Figure 2-B-6 in the notes shows the mathematical formulas for the Black (1976) formula. This formula is used in both the CME option pricing calculator and Professor Vercammen’s Excel model, “option_pricing_model.xlsx”, to generate call and put prices. Suppose r = 0.0196, T = 0.28 and X (the strike price) = 4.10. The table below shows the Black (1976) prices of call and put options as a function of σ (futures price volatility) and F (current futures price).</p>

    <div class=figure>

            width="441" height="383"</p>
            
    </div>


    <ol start="9"> 
        <li>All else equal higher levels of futures price volatility _______ (increases, decreases) the _______ (intrinsic, time) value of both put and call options. Vega is a measure of the sensitivity of the option price to changes in volatility. Vega is largest for option prices which are ________ (deep out of the money, near the money, deep in the money).</li> 
        <br/>

        <li>Using the table above, if the price of a call with a 3.90 strike is 0.1646 then the level of volatility is _____. One can envision using the Black (1976) formula in Figure 2-B-6 and Excel's solver function to recover the value of &sigma; for any futures price - strike price combination. The special name we give to the recovered value of &sigma; is _______ (implied volatility (IV), calculated volatility (CV)) and we interpret it as the estimated value of &sigma; across all traders, assuming that traders are using the Black (1976) formula to price options. </li> 
        <br/>
       
        <p>The table below is similar to the previous table except now the futures price is held fixed at $4.00/bu the strike price is varied between 4.00 and 4.25.</p>

        <div class=figure>
            <p><img src="http://blogs.ubc.ca/jvercammen/files/2019/11/iv_smile_quizprep_.jpg"
                width="316" height="165"</p>
                
        </div>

        <li>Suppose we observe on the CME settlement tab that a call option with a strike price of 4.00 is trading at 0.2517, and a call option with a strike price of 4.25 is trading at 0.1781. Based on the previous table you would calculate the IV equal to ____ for the 4.00 call and _____ for the 4.25 call. You are puzzled because the Black (1976) formula shows that the volatility parameter does not change with different assumptions about the strike price. According to Black (1976), if volatility is 0.3 then the call price should equal _____ when the strike price is 4.25. There must be a reason why traders are adding a _____ (positive, negative) fudge factor of size _____ to the price of the call relative to the Black (1976) price. </li> 
        <br/>

        <li>One logical conclusion is that for a call option, as the strike price decreases and the option moves further out of the money the Black (1976) formula is _______ (under, over) estimating the true market risk. This is understandable because the Black (1976) formula assumes that the percent change in price is normally distributed. The shape of the tails of the distribution are extremely important for the pricing of an option. The more probability weight in the tail, the higher the chance that the option may finish in the money. In the current scenario, it appears that the tail of the distribution that traders have in mind is _____ (more, less) fat than that of a normal distribution. The situation is the same for a put. In this case, as the strike price decreases and the put moves deeper out of the money, the call price decreases by _____ (less, more) than that which is predicted by the Black (1976) model. </li>
        <br/>  

        <li>Suppose a graph is created with the option's strike on the horizontal axis and implied volatility on the vertical axis. According to the Black (1976) formula as the strike price increases above the futures price, the graph of IV ______ (increases, decreases, remains flat). However, if the implied volatility (IV) is calculated using the market price of a call for each of the different strike prices, then the graph of this IV ____ (increases, decreases, remains flat) as the futures price increases. The situation is similar for the put option as the strike price decreases below the futures price. The combined graph will therefore have the appearance of a _____ (frown, smile, smirk). A more curved graph implies that the price distribution which traders have in mind has tails which are _____ (more, less) fat than the tails of a normal distribution. </li>

    <ol start="14"> 
         
        <li>
            <p>A merchant who would normally hedge with a short futures contract can instead hedge with a ____ (call, put) option. This is because the payout of the put is ____ (lower, higher) when the futures price is lower. Thus the gain/loss on the put will be opposite the gain/loss in the spot market provided that the futures and spot prices are _____ (positively, negatively) correlated. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Unlike a futures contract, a merchant hedging with an option contract can select different degrees of implicit price insurance by selecting different _____ (futures, strike) prices. Merchants who can absorb a moderate amount of risk but wish to have some degree of price insurance will choose a strike price which is ______ (a little, a lot) ______ (below, above) the strike price. </p>
            
             
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Another attractive feature of hedging with options is that a ______ (broker, margin) account is not required. Basis risk, which reduces the effectiveness of the option, is ____ (zero, also present) when hedging with an options contract. In real world markets, merchants tend to hedge using an over-the-counter ____ (swap, swipe) contract rather than a CME options contract. </p>
