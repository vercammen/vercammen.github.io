        <p>As previously noted, a key role of a commodity futures market is to facilitate hedging by merchants who operate in the spot market and wish to minimize price risk. Farmers can hedge by signing forward contracts with a commodity merchant such as Cargill or a farmer-owned cooperative. Once the forward contract is signed the merchant faces price risk because the price that will be paid to the farmer in the future is locked in but the price the merchant will receive when the commodity is resold is uncertain. The merchant can use a <u>short</u> hedge to minimize this price risk. Suppose instead that a flour mill uses a forward contract to lock in the price of flour that is to be delivered to a large scale bakery in three months time. The flour mill is concerned that the price of its key ingredient, wheat, will rise between when the price of flour is locked in and when the wheat is purchased in the spot market. The flour mill can use a <u>long</u> hedge to minimize this price risk.</p>
    
        <p>The analysis and results for the short and long hedge are mirror images of each other. For example, if price moves in a way that results in a $0.16/bu loss for the short hedger, then that same price movement will result in a $0.16/bu gain for the long hedger. For this reason in Section (ii) of this module, which shows simulated profits and losses from hedging, the focus is on the short hedger, and it is left to the reader to work out the analogous results for the long hedger.</p>
    
        <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a002"></a>(i) Price Risk Case Study</h3>
    
        <p>To illustrate the price risk in the U.S. corn market daily spot prices were collected for a three year period: April 29, 2016 to April 26, 2019. The spot prices are the farm-level bid prices on offer by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) at their Decatur, Illinois grain collection facility. As was previously illustrated in Figure 1-C-2, the ADM bid prices are constructed by adding a basis that is specific to Decatur, Illinois to the price of the nearest futures contract. New futures contracts replace expiring futures contracts on an on-going basis. The data was downloaded from the Bloomberg terminal on April 29, 2019.</p>
    
        <p>Figure 1-D-1 is a graph of the ADM spot price (red line) and the CBOT (nearest to expiry) futures price (blue line) for corn. This graph shows that in the last three years the U.S. corn market has experienced high levels of price volatility, ranging from a high of $4.45/bushel on June 17, 2016 to a low of $3.08/bu on September 18, 2018. A merchant could potentially make large losses or large gains in the corn spot market, depending on when specifically the hedge is initiated and later terminated.</p>

        </div>
    
        <p>Recall that the basis is defined as the spot price minus the futures price. Figure 1-D-2 shows the basis within the Decatur corn market. The consistent negative value for the basis primarily reflects the location adjustment that was discussed in Module 1-C. The basis is quite variable and it appears that its movement over time is positively correlated with the spot and futures price movements. This outcome is expected because the price of corn tends to be low when stocks are high and vice versa. High (low) stocks are consistent with a more (less) negative basis because of a higher (lower) cost of storage and a lower (higher) convenience yield. As will be shown below, variation in the basis is an important determinant of the overall effectiveness of a merchant's hedging strategy.</p>

        <p>A simple way to measure price risk facing ADM in the corn market over the April, 2016 - April, 2019 time interval is to calculate the profit and loss for a series of rolling market transactions. Specifically, assume that ADM purchases corn in the spot market on the first trading day of each month and sells that corn two months later (also coinciding with the first trading day). This is done for 34 consecutive months over the April, 2016 - April, 2019 time interval. The mean profit of -$0.026/bu over the 34 trades reveals that the gains and losses largely cancel. The 0.278 standard deviation of profit reveals considerable variability. Figure 1-D-3 shows a graph of the losses and profits on the 34 trades, arranged in order of the least to the most profitable.   </p>
    
        <p>Assume that ADM makes one trade that is randomly drawn from the set of 34. If each trade is equally likely then it follows that ADM faces a 26.47 percent (9/34) chance of receiving a loss in excess of $0.20/bu, and a 8.82 percent (3/34) chance of receiving a loss in excess of $0.40/bu. For a company that forward buys and sells millions of bushels of corn each week this level of price risk, if left unhedged, would result in a high level of revenue variability. For a small grain buyer or a local farmer cooperative, this level of price risk could result in financial ruin. Hedging to reduce price risk is therefore a critically important management decision.   </p>

        <p>Price risk is relevant for both sellers and buyers of the commodity. Sellers manage price risk through use of a short hedge and buyers manage price risk through use of a long hedge. The mechanics of each of these hedging mechanisms are discussed in turn.</p>

            <blockquote><font size="4">Short Hedge</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
    
        <p>A short hedge is used by a merchant who owns unpriced commodity (or is precommitted to purchasing the commodity at a previously agreed price) and is worried that the spot price will decrease between when the price is locked in and when the commodity is sold. A common scenario is a grain buyer who has precommited to purchasing the commodity from a local farmer at a fixed price, and who plans to resell that commodity in two months time to an overseas customer at the spot price which will emerge in two months time.</p>

            <p>A short hedge involves taking a short position in the futures market when the price risk begins (e.g., July in the previous example) and offsetting the short position with a long position (i.e., "lifting" the hedge) when the commodity is sold. </p> 
            <p>The short hedge works because gains in the futures market tends to offset losses in the sport market, and vice versa. </p> 
        </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>Figure 1-D-4 provides the data that is needed to analyze a short hedging scenario. On June 1, 2018 ADM signs a forward pricing agreement with a local Decatur, Illinois farmer. The agreement requires the farmer to deliver 5000 bushels of corn on September 28, and upon delivery the farmer will be paid $3.83/bu, which is the current (June 1) spot price. ADM faces price risk because it has committed to purchase the corn at $3.83/bu and it will sell the corn in the Decatur spot market on September 28, possibly at a lower price. To hedge its position, ADM takes a short position (one 5000 bushel contract) on June 1 in the CBOT corn market at price $4.30/bu. According to Figure 1-D-4, when the farmer delivers the corn to ADM on September 28 it will immediately be resold by ADM at a spot price equal to $3.49/bu. On this same day ADM offsets its short futures position by taking a long position at price $3.98/bu.</p>

                <p>ADM earns (before commission) 4.30 - 3.98 = $0.32 in the futures market.</p>
                <p>ADM has a net gain (before commission) of -0.34 + 0.32 = -$0.02/bu.</p>

        </div>
    
        <p>The hedge was largely effective because ADM's $0.32/bu gain in the futures market offset most of its $0.34/bu loss in the spot market. If the spot price had increased instead of decreased, then the loss in the futures contract would largely have been offset by the gain in the spot market. An important difference between the two scenarios is that in the first case ADM will receive deposits in its margin account as the gains from futures trading accumulate. In the second case ADM would be required to continually deposit money in its margin account as the losses from futures trading accumulate.</p>
    
        <p>Consider the same short hedging scenario as described above but now assume that the time period is August 14, 2017 to October 13, 2017, and the prices are those which are illustrated in Figure 1-D-5. </p>

            <p>ADM earns (before commission) 4.27 - 4.15 = $0.12 in the futures market.</p>
            <p>ADM has a net gain (before commission) of -0.41 + 0.12 = -$0.29/bu.</p> 
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>In this case the short hedge was only partially effective because without the hedge the loss is $0.41/bu and with the hedge the loss is $0.29/bu. The difference in effectiveness for the two scenarios is explained below.

        </p>

        
        <p>A long hedge can be illustrated with the price data from Figures 1-D-4 and 1-D-5. In both cases assume that on the initial date (i.e., left side of graph) ADM forward sells corn to a nearby ethanol plant at the prevailing spot price. To fulfil its contractual obligations, ADM will purchase corn in the spot market on the terminal date (i.e., right side of graph) and deliver the corn to the ethanol plant shortly thereafter. ADM is concerned with the negative profits that will result if the spot price of corn increases between the initial and terminal dates. To hedge against this possibility, ADM takes a long futures position on the initial date and offsets this position with a short contract on the terminal date.</p>
        <br/>
    
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 660px; background-color: #0404B4;">
        <div style="position: relative; top: -10px; left: -10px; padding: 10px; background: #CCFFFF; border: 2px solid #0404B4;">
            <p>In the first scenario (Figure 1-D-4) ADM earns 3.83 - 3.49 = $0.34 on the forward contract in the spot market and earns 3.98 - 4.30 = -$0.32/bu in the futures market. The net gain across both markets is $0.02/bu. </p> 
            <p>In the second scenario (Figure 1-D-5) ADM earns 3.63 - 3.22 = $0.41 on the forward contract in the spot market and earns 4.15 - 4.27 = -$0.12/bu in the futures market. The net gain across both markets is $0.29/bu. </p> 
        </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>It is clear that the gains and losses for the long hedger are opposite those of the short hedger. In the long hedge scenario, with the benefit of hindsight, ADM would have preferred to not have a hedge because the spot price dropped. This is an important property of both short and long hedging: hedging reduces the size of a potential loss in profits but it also reduces the size of a potential gain in profits. The analysis above shows that hedging does not fully eliminate the loss or gain in profits that result from unexpected price movements. The determinants of hedging profits for both the short and long hedge is examined next. </p>

            <blockquote><font size="4">Determinants of Profits and Losses from Hedging</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
        
        <p> Simple theory can be used to the identify the conditions under which hedging results in positive or negative profits. To make the theory more precise it is necessary to account for the merchant's cost of storage (this was ignored in the previous set of examples). Let  W<sub>0,1</sub> denote the merchant's cost of storing the commodity between when the hedge is initiated and when it is terminated. Let P<sub>0</sub> denote the initial spot price when the hedge is initiated and let P<sub>1</sub> denote the terminal spot price when the hedge is terminated. Similarly, let Let F<sub>0</sub> denote the initial futures price and let F<sub>1</sub> denote the terminal futures price. 
        
        <p> For the short hedge, combined profits from the spot and futures markets (excluding commission fees) can be expressed as &pi;<sup>S</sup> = (P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>0</sub>) + (F<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>1</sub>) - W<sub>0,1</sub>.  For the long hedge, combined profits can be expressed as &pi;<sup>L</sup> = (P<sub>0</sub> +  W<sub>0,1</sub> - P<sub>1</sub>) + (F<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>0</sub>). The reason why W<sub>0,1</sub> is added to P<sub>0</sub> in the long hedge case is because if the merchant receives the commodity when the hedge is terminated as part of the forward contract rather than purchasing the commodity at the initial date, then the merchant saves paying the storage cost. In a competitive market this storage cost savings is added to P<sub>0</sub> when the forward contract is negotiated.</p> 
            
        <p>The previous set of equations can be rearranged to give &pi;<sup>S</sup> = (P<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>1</sub>) - (P<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>0</sub>) - W<sub>0,1</sub> for the short hedge, and &pi;<sup>L</sup> = -[(P<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>1</sub>) - (P<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>0</sub>) - W<sub>0,1</sub>] for the long hedge. Noting that B<sub>0</sub> = P<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>0</sub> is the initial basis and B<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>1</sub> is the terminal basis it follows from the above equations that:</p>
    
        <br/>
    
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 700px; background-color: #0404B4;">
        <div style="position: relative; top: -10px; left: -10px; padding: 10px; background: #CCFFFF; border: 2px solid #0404B4;">
            <p>Profits from the short hedge equal the change in the basis between when the hedge is placed and when it is lifted minus the storage cost: &pi;<sup>S</sup> = B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - W<sub>0,1</sub> </p> 
            <p>Profits from the long hedge equal the negative of the change in the basis between when the hedge is placed and when it is lifted minus the storage cost: &pi;<sup>L</sup> = -[B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - W<sub>0,1</sub>]</p> 
        </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>This theoretical result is easily confirmed for the case of the short hedge and the set of prices that are illustrated in Figures 1-D-4 and 1-D-5 (assume storage costs are equal to zero). In Figure 1-D-4, the initial basis is B<sub>0</sub> = 3.83 - 4.30 = -0.47 and the terminal basis is B<sub>1</sub> = 3.49 - 3.98 = -0.49. The change in the basis is B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> = -0.49 - (-0.47) = -0.02. In Figure 1-D-5, the initial basis is B<sub>0</sub> = 3.63 - 4.27 = -0.64 and the terminal basis is B<sub>1</sub> = 3.22 - 4.15 = -0.93. The change in the basis is B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> = -0.93 - (-0.64) = -0.29. These values are the same as the hedging losses that were previously calculated. The examples are therefore consistent with the theory. </p>
    
        <p>The basis is a stochastic variable similar to the spot price and the futures price. It should be clear that hedging eliminates the risk of a changing spot price and instead leaves the merchant with the risk of a changing basis. As Figure 1-C-10 illustrates, there was substantial variability in the basis in the U.S. corn market during the April, 2016 to April, 2019 time interval. This variability in the basis reduced the effectiveness of both short and long hedging during this period by a significant amount. It should be noted that basis risk also affects farmers who lock in a price using a forward contract rather than using futures contracts. This is because the spot price offered to the farmer is the current futures price plus the basis. For a given contract the farmer faces no uncertainty because the price is locked in but year-to-year the farmer faces both uncertainty in the futures price and uncertainty in the basis.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this section is to use the simulation results from Module 1-C to examine how the basis is expected to change across the different seasons of the marketing year and with different levels of seasonally-adjusted stocks. Identifying the expected changes in the basis allows the expected profits of the hedge to be fully identified.</p>

            <blockquote><font size="4">Strengthening and Weakening Basis</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
    
        <p>Based on the previous analysis it should be clear that a short hedger earns positive profits if the basis increases in value over the hedging period, which means becoming either more positive or less negative in value. To avoid confusion, the term <u>strengthening</u> basis refers to a basis that increases in value over time and thus generates positive profits for the short hedger. In contrast, the term <u>weakening</u> basis refers to a basis that decreases in value over time (less positive or more negative) and thus generates negative profits for the short hedger.</p>
    
        <p>It is important to keep in mind that after making the adjustment for location, the basis converges to zero as the futures contract approaches its expiry date. This means that if a basis is expected to strengthen over the hedging period then in order to end up with a value of zero the value of the basis at the start of the hedging period must be less positive or more negative than the value which would generate zero expected gross hedging profits. In other words, if the basis is expected to <u>strengthen</u> over time then the initial basis must be <u>weak</u> relative to the zero gross profit benchmark basis. Similarly, if a basis is expected to <u>weaken</u> over time then the initial value of the basis must be <u>strong</u> (i.e., more positive or less negative relative to the zero gross profit benchmark basis).

        </p>
    
        <p>It is important to keep in mind that profits from hedging depend on how the basis changes over time rather than whether the basis is positive or negative when the hedge is placed. In the simulation results that were presented in Module 1-C it was shown that the basis is generally positive at the Gulf Coast and is generally negative at Kansas City. Even though the spot price is lower in the Kansas City market than in the Gulf Coast market, this price difference does not impact hedging profits unless it changes over time. It turns out that the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price difference does change over time and this change is an important determinant of hedging profits.</p>
    
        <p>Figure 1-D-6 is a copy of Figure 1-C-6 from the previous module. Specifically, Figure 1-D-6 assumes the hedger is located at the Gulf Coast, and the year 1 carry over is positive because the potential for a year 2 is loss is large. The positive carry over of stocks results in a positive slope of the forward curve and a basis that continually becomes more positive over the 8 quarters of the simulation model. Consequently, gross hedging profits are positive regardless of when the hedge is initially placed (i.e., Q2 versus Q3 versus Q4. The cost of holding the stocks over the hedging period must be subtracted from gross hedging profits to arrive at net hedging profits.</p>

            </div>
    
        <p>Recall that the price spread in the forward curve reflects the expected change in the basis across the dates of the spread given the assumption of normal price expectations. In Figure 1-D-6 suppose the hedge is placed in Q4 and lifted in Q6. The direct way to measure gross hedging profits is to subtract the Q4 basis from the Q6 basis. The indirect way to measure gross hedging profits is to measure the price spread on the forward curve between Q4 and Q6. In the first case one must observe how the basis changes over time in order to determine hedging profits whereas in the second case expected profits are implied by the slope of the forward curve at the beginning of the hedging period. In real world hedging analysis it is not common to measure hedging profits using price spreads from the forward curve because generally the futures prices which appear in the forward curve do not correspond to the beginning and end of the hedging period.</p>
    
        <p>Tables 1-D-1 and 1-D-2 decompose gross hedging profits in the Kansas City market into two components: (1) the bit that is due to a reduction in the carrying cost and the bit that is due to a reduction in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount. Table 1-D-1 corresponds to the carryover scenario, and Table 1-D-2 corresponds to the stockout scenario. The left-hand set of columns contain the equilibrium prices in Q2 through Q6 (note that Q6 is an expected price rather than an actual price). Within these four columns, the values in the top two rows are the simulated Gulf Coast spot prices and carrying charges, the latter calculated beginning when the hedge was placed and ending in Q7, which is when the futures contract expires. Summing the values in these two rows gives the expected value of the Q7 Gulf Coast spot price ($4.126/bu). After subtracting from this value the Q7 Gulf Coast - Chicago price discount ($0.345/bu in the third row) the result is the expected Q7 Chicago spot price ($3.781/bu). With the assumption of normal price expectations and price convergence, the expected Q7 Chicago spot price is the equilibrium value of a F7 futures contract, which remains constant over the Q2 to Q6 hedging period. The $3.781/bu futures price is reported in the fourth row of Tables 1-D-1 and 1-D-2. Now calculate the Kansas City spot prices by subtracting the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discounts in the fifth row from the Gulf Coast Spot prices in the top row. The resulting set of Kansas City spot prices (sixth row) minus the $3.781 price of the F7 futures contract gives the basis for Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q6 (seventh row).</p>

        </div>
    
        <p>The right columns in Tables 1-D-1 and 1-D-2 show the price reductions across the hedging periods. The most important rows are the second, which show the reduction in the carrying cost, the fifth, which show the reduction in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount, and the seventh, which show the negative of the change in the Kansas City basis. By construction, the reduction in the carrying charge, which raises the Kansas City spot price relative to the futures price, and the reduction in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount, which also raises the Kansas City spot relative to the futures price, comprises the total increase in the basis. Thus, the sum of the values in the second and fifth rows equal the negative of the change in the basis. These change in basis values, multiplied by -1 to obtain the correct sign, are measures of gross hedging profits (see the bottom right corner of Tables 1-D-1 and 1-D-2).</p>
    
        <p> Table 1-D-1 shows that for the case of a positive carry over of stock, gross hedging profits are larger the longer the hedging period (e.g., $0.302/bu for a Q2 - Q6 hedge versus $0.099/bu for a Q4 - Q6 hedge). This is an expected result. A result that is not expected is that if the hedge is placed in Q3 and lifted in Q6, gross hedging profits are reduced from $0.215/bu to $0.166/bu (a loss of 22.8 percent) due to the unfavourable movement in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount. The percentage loss is even larger for a hedge that is placed in Q4 and lifted in Q6 (hedging profits are reduced from $0.146/bu to $0.099/bu, which is 32.2 percent). Without information on the cost of the hedge, which will increase with a longer hedging period due to a higher cost of storage, it is not possible to calculate net hedging profits. However, if the hedger's cost of storage is at least as large as the market's carrying cost, then the results from Table 1-D-1 imply negative net profits for the Kansas City short hedger in the carry over scenario.</p>

        </div>
    
        <p> Table 1-D-2 shows the same results as Table 1-D-1 except now the year 1 market stocks out rather than carrying over positive stock to year 2 (this is due to the smaller potential loss in the year 2 harvest). The main difference across the two tables is that in Table 1-D-2 the sharp drop in the Q5 spot price that results from the stockout causes the basis to spike down to a large negative value before once again strengthening over time. This downward spike implies that the value of the basis in Q6 is lower than what would be the case in the absence of a stockout. Thus, the change in the basis for all three scenarios (Q2 - Q6, Q3 - Q6 and Q4 - Q6) is smaller as a result of the stockout. This means that gross hedging profits are lower for the Q2 - Q6, Q3 - Q6 and Q4 - Q6 hedging scenarios with the stockout (Table 1-D-1) versus positive carry over (Table 1-D-2). To arrive at this conclusion note that the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount is the same in Tables 1-D-1 and 1-D-2.</p>

        <p>The gross profits for a hedger in the Gulf Coast spot market are presented for the carryover case (Table 1-D-3) and the stockout case (Table 1-D-4). Similar to the Kansas City market outcome, the carrying charge is positive and increases with the length of the hedging period in the carry over case and is initially positive but decreases to a negative value in the stock out case. In the Gulf Coast market there are no offsetting negative changes in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discounts to reduce gross hedging profits. Thus, the change in the carrying charge is equal to gross hedging profits. The change in the Gulf Coast - Chicago price discount over the Q2 through Q4 period does not affect hedging profits for both the Kansas City and Gulf Coast hedger because the hedge is lifted in Q6 in all scenarios. If the hedger could select which quarter to lift the hedge then the change in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount would affect hedging profits in both Kansas City and the Gulf Coast.</p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Strengthening versus Weakening Basis: Revisited</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
    
        <p>Earlier in this module the concept of a weak basis that strengthens over time and a strong basis that weakens over time was introduced. The connection between this concept and expected gross profits from hedging can now be fully specified. Figure 1-D-7 illustrates the theoretical case where high stocks cause the basis to be weak when the hedge is placed but to strengthen continually over time until the hedge is lifted. The basis takes on negative values because the transportation cost from the spot market to the Gulf Coast market is assumed to be large (e.g., the Kansas City scenario). The diagram for the case of a positive basis (e.g., a spot market close to the Gulf Coast), would look similar except the two upward sloping schedules would lie above the horizontal axis. For the alternative case where stocks are below the long term average the low cost of storage and high convenience yield would cause the dashed line in Figure 1-D-10 to lie above the solid line. In this case the basis is strong when the hedge is placed but would gradually weaken over time.</p>

        <br/>
    
        <p>Figure 1-D-7 can be now be used to connect the expected profits of the short and long hedge as a function of whether stocks are above or below their long term average levels. To simplify, assume the unit cost of storage is indepenent of the level of stocks in the market. Noting that the profitability of the short hedge can be expressed as the  &pi;<sup>S</sup> = B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - W<sub>0,1</sub> it follows that the increase in expected hedging profits in a high stock year relative to long term average profits can be expressed as:</p> 
    
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 900px;border:1px solid red">
            &pi;<sup>S</sup> - &pi;<sup>S,*</sup>= B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - [B<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup> - B<sub>0</sub><sup>*</sup>]
        </div>
    
        <p>This expression can be rewritten as</p>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 900px;border:1px solid red">
            &pi;<sup>S</sup> - &pi;<sup>S,*</sup>= [-B<sub>0</sub> - (B<sub>0</sub><sup>*</sup>)] - [-B<sub>1</sub> - (B<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup>)]
        </div>
    
        <p>Using this latter expression together with Figure 1-D-7 it follows immediately that expected profits for the short hedger in a high stock year are positive relative to long term average profits. The following properties of hedging profits can be derived using logic that is similar to what was used above.</p>

            <blockquote><font size="4">Backwardation and Contango: Traditional View</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
    
        <p>Throughout the previous analysis we have assumed that the futures price is an unbiased forecast of the up-and-coming spot price. This assumption is referred to as <u> normal expectations</u>. An alternative theory proposed by Keynes in 1930 is referred to as <u> normal backwardation</u>. Keynes believed that risk averse short hedgers pay a premium to speculators as a way to compensate speculators for accepting price risk. The premium is paid implicitly by virtue of a futures price that is biased downward. Keynes believed that with an unbiased futures price the hedger's demand for short futures contracts will exceed the speculator's demand for long futures contracts. Equilibrium is achieved when the futures price is bid down enough to ensure that the demand for short contracts is equal to the demand for long contracts. The downward <i>hedging pressure</i> results in an expected profit for speculators and an expected loss for hedgers.</p>
    
        <p>The opposite of backwardation is contango. In this case there is an excess demand for long contracts by speculators, and this excess demand bids the current futures price above the futures price that traders believe will prevail when the futures contract expires. The excess demand for long positions may emerge for a number of reasons, including the passive demand by hedge funds and other institutional investors for the purpose of diversifying their overall financial portfolios. With contango short hedgers expect to earn a positive profit because the initial futures price is relatively high when the short position is initiated and the expiring futures price is relatively low when the short position is offset.</p> 
            
        <p>Backwardation and contango can be illustrated in two alternative ways. First, for a particular futures contract, with backwardation (contango) the expected futures price increases (decreases) over time and the bias gradually diminishes until it reaches zero when the futures contract expires. Second, at a particular point in time backwardation and contango affects the price spreads in the forward curve. Figure 1-D-8 shows the first way for the case of backwardation. Notice that the initial basis is strong and it weakens over time relative to the case of normal price expectations. It therefore follows that a short hedger expects negative expected profits if the market is characterized by backwardation. Figure 1-D-9 is the same as Figure 1-D-8 except it assumes there is contango rather than backwardation. In this case the initial basis is weak and it is expected to strengthen over time relative to the case of normal price expectations. Now the short hedger expects to earn positive profits.</p>

        <br/>
    
        <p>To illustrate backwardation and contango with the forward curve it is useful to return to the simulation results for the case of a Gulf Coast hedger in a market with year 1 carry over. Figure 1-D-10 is the same as Figure 1-D-6 except the forward curve has pivoted down due to backwardation (without backwardation the forward curve would connect the tops of the solid coloured columns). The striped columns show the height of the backwardated forward curve from the perspective of the hedger in Q4. Notice that the price of the F7 curve is biased down the most and there is no downward bias for the expiring F4 contract. In other words, the backwardation has flattened the forward curve. The horizontal dashed line shows the futures price in Q4 and thus defines the Q4 basis. Notice that the basis is much larger (i.e., more positive) than what would be the case with normal price expectations. The strong initial basis implies that the basis weakens over time relative to the case of normal price expectations. In fact, Figure 1-D-10 shows that the basis is approximately the same in Q4 when the hedge is placed as it is in Q7 when the hedge is lifted. Relative to the case of normal price expectations where the basis increases in value over time, the hedger should expect negative profits.</p>

            <blockquote><font size="4">Backwardation and Contango: Modern View</font> </blockquote>
        </p>  
    
        <p>The second (modern) interpretation of backwardation and contango is that these concepts refer to a situation where a temporary shortage or surplus of the commodity has caused the price to rise above or fall below the equilibrium price, and traders anticipate that the price will gradually regain equilibrium. In a backwardated (contango) market, the forward curve slopes down (up) because with the gradual elimination of the commodity shortage (surplus), the spot and futures price are expected to gradually decrease (increase) over time. With this interpretation of backwardation and contango traders have normal price expectations because the spot and futures price are expected to move in the same direction in response to the temporary shortfall or surplus. In summary, the classic and modern interpretations of backwardation and contango both give rise to a sloped forward curve but the reasons for the slope are very different.</p>
    
        <p>The modern interpretation of backwardation can be illustated using results from the simulation model, assuming the Gulf Coast market with a year 1 stockout. Begin by changing the values of the parameters which define the cost of carry schedule. Specifically, replace m<sub>0</sub> = 0.05 with m<sub>0</sub> = 0.04 and replace m<sub>1</sub> = 0.005 with m<sub>1</sub> = 0.008. This change implies a larger convenience yield for merchants who hold stock. Assuming that the market stocks out, the equilibrium Gulf Coast spot prices for the first four quarters are as follows:
        P1 = 3:664, P2 = 3:706, P3 = 3:720 and P4 = 3:707. Notice that the price increases from Q1
        through Q3 and then decreases from Q3 to Q4. This occurs because as stocks diminish toward
        the end of the marketing year the carrying cost switches from a positive to a negative value due to the rising convenience yield.</p> 
        
        <p>In the previous example, the forward curves slopes up for Q1 through Q3 and slopes down for Q3 to Q4. According to the modern interpretation of backwardation the downward sloping forward curve when moving from Q3 to Q4 is evidence of backwardation. Specifically, traders will understand that the shortage of commodity in Q4 is temporarily driving up convenience yield, which in turn is driving up Q4 spot price of the commodity. When new stocks arrive and the convenience yield declines, the spot price will also decline. Thus, the forward curve slopes down even while maintaining the assumption of normal price expectations for traders. When modeling commodity prices with normal price expectations in the first part of this paper, a high convenience yield which causes the forward curve to slope down would be described as an inverted market and not a backwardated market. </p>

            <li>Calculate your profit/loss in the spot market if you did not hedge. How does your gross profits/loss with the hedge compare with your profit/loss if you did not hedge? Should these values be either both positive or both negative? Or can one be positive and one be negative? Briefly explain.</li>

       <li><p>Module 1.D emphasized that hedging does not fully eliminate the variance in profits if the basis fluctuates over time. If a manager wants to minimize the variance of net hedging profits then the fraction of the spot market position that is hedged should be scaled back to account for fluctuations in the basis. The optimal fraction to hedge is referred to as the minimum variance hedging ratio.

    <ol start="5"> 
        <li>Shorting in the stock market involves borrowing the stock, immediately selling it and then later rebuying the stock in order to repay the stock that was on loan. A trader who shorts a stock earns _________ (negative, positive) profit if the price of the stock decreases between when the stock was borrowed and when it was repaid.  A long hedge implies that the merchant has a ______ (long, short) position in the spot market.</li> 
        <br/>

        <li>Suppose on April 29 a grain buyer in Dacatur agrees to pay a local corn farmer the current spot price of $3.94/bu when the corn is delivered on October 7th. The buyer intends to immediately sell the corn at the October 7th spot price when it is delivered on October 7th. The grain buyer should use a ______ (short, long) hedge to reduce price risk. With the optimal hedge in place, the buyer will earn ______ (positive, negative) profits if the futures price decreases faster than the spot price over the April 29  - Octobr 7 period.</li> 
        <br/>
          
        <li>While it is true that hedging eliminates price risk if the gains on the futures transaction fully offset losses in the spot market and vice versa, it is not the case that hedging is neutral with respect to the interim cash flow. With a short hedge, the merchant will face large margin calls if the spot price ________ (decreases, increases) strongly over time. Margin calls can be financed with loans secured with the commodity as collateral in the case of the ________ (short, long) hedge. </li> 
        <br/>

        <li>If spot and futures prices are trending up, an increase in the basis over time implies that the spot price has _______ (decreased, increased) relative to the futures price, which in turn implies that gains in the spot market have been ______ (less, greater) than losses in the futures market.</li>
        <br/>  

        <li>In the Kansas City spot market, a short hedger earns ______ (negative, positive) profits if the basis becomes more negative over time, which is equivalent to a ______ (decrease, increase) in the absolute size of the basis. </li>

    <h5><i>Answer the following questions and be prepared to answer very similar questions during the in-class Canvas quiz:</i></h5>
          
    <ol start="10"> 
         
        <li>
            <p>Which of the following statements best describes expected hedging profits in the Gulf Coast spot market assuming normal price expectations.</p>
            
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Gross profits for the short hedger are positive if the spot price is expected to increase over time due to a positive carrying charge. </li>
                <li>Net hedging profits is equal to gross hedging profits minus the trader's cost of carrying the commodity minus commission charges for trading futures.</li>
                <li>The short hedger expects positive net profits if the market's cost of carry is greater than the trader's personal cost of carry.</li>
                <li>All of the above.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>This question compares gross hedging profits when the market stocks out rather than carrying over stocks from one year to the next.</p>
            
            <ol type="a">
                <li>A stockout typically results in a strengthening of the basis over the harvesting period. </li>
                <li>Gross profits for the short hedger are more likely to be positive if the market stocks out versus carries stocks across marketing years.</li>
                <li>All else equal, hedging profits are more likely to be positive in the Gulf Coast market versus the Kansas City market because the basis is positive at the Gulf Coast and negative at Kansas City. </li>
                <li>None of the above.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Suppose the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount increases over the hedging period and the carrying charge remains constant over time. The impact of this change on expected gross hedging profits is expected to:</p>
            
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Be negative.  </li>
                <li>Be positive. </li>
                <li>Have no impact.</li>
                <li>Have an ambiguous sign (i.e., negative or positive).</li>

        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Corn futures trade in December, 2019 and March, 2020. Suppose a short hedge is initiated on December 15 (i.e., when the December contract is about to expire) and is lifted on March 15 (i.e., when the March contract is about to expire). With normal price expectations, gross profits are expected to equal:</p>
            
            <ol type="a">
                <li>The December 15th basis minus the March 15th basis.  </li>
                <li>The December 15th basis plus the December - March price spread</li>
                <li>The December 15th basis minus the December - March price spread</li>
                <li>The December - March price spread</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <br/>
        <li> The basis generally takes on a low value when stocks are high. As stocks diminish the basis gradually returns to its long run equilibrium level, which is equivalent to saying that the basis is ___________ (weakening, strengthening) over time. The low stocks caused the initial basis to be __________ (weak, strong).</li>

        <br/>
        <li>Suppose the basis in the Kansas City market is strong when the hedge is initiated. This means that the value of the basis is ________ (less, more) negative than what is usual. A stronger initial hedge in the Kansas City market is equivalent to a _________ (smaller, larger) absolute value of the initial basis.</li>

        <br/>
        <li> Normal backwadation causes the intial basis to be _________ (weak, strong) because the futures price is bid ________ (up, down) relative to the expected futures price when the contract expires. Normal backwardation gradually diminishes over time and thus the basis gradually _________ (weakens, strengthens) over time.    
        </li>

        <br/>
        <li> Contango tilts the forward curve _______ (down, up) because when the hedge is initiated the futures price is _________ (below, above) the expected futures price when the contract expires.   
        </li>

        <br/>
        <li>With the modern interpretation of backwardation, there is a temporary _________ (shortage, surplus) of the commodity and so the price of a futures contract with a long time until expiry is priced ______ (lower, higher) than a contract with a short time until expiry.
