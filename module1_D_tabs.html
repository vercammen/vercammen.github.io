        <p>A key role of a commodity futures market is to facilitate hedging by merchants who operate in the spot market and wish to minimize price risk. Farmers can hedge by signing forward contracts with a commodity merchant such as Cargill or a farmer-owned cooperative. Once the forward contract is signed the merchant faces price risk because the price that will be paid to the farmer in the future is locked in but the price the merchant will receive when the commodity is resold is uncertain. The merchant can use a <u>short</u> hedge to minimize this price risk. Suppose instead that a flour mill uses a forward contract to lock in the price of flour that is to be delivered to a large scale bakery in three months time. The flour mill is concerned that the price of its key ingredient, wheat, will rise between when the price of flour is locked in and when the wheat is purchased in the spot market. The flour mill can use a <u>long</u> hedge to minimize this price risk.</p>
    
        <p>The analysis and results for the short and long hedge are mirror images of each other. For example, if price moves in a way that results in a $0.16/bu loss for the short hedger, then that same price movement will result in a $0.16/bu gain for the long hedger. For this reason in Section (ii) of this module, which shows simulated profits and losses from hedging, the focus is on the short hedger, and it is left to the reader to work out the analogous results for the long hedger.</p>
    
        <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a002"></a>(i) Price Risk Case Study</h3>
    
        <p>To illustrate the price risk in the U.S. corn market daily spot prices were collected for a three year period: April 29, 2016 to April 26, 2019. The spot prices are the farm-level bid prices on offer by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) at their Decatur, Illinois grain collection facility. The ADM bid prices are constructed by adding a basis that is specific to Decatur, Illinois to the price of the nearest futures contract. New futures contracts replace expiring futures contracts on an on-going basis. The data was downloaded from the Bloomberg terminal on April 29, 2019.</p>
    
        <p>Figure 1-D-1 is a graph of the ADM spot price (red line) and the CBOT (nearest to expiry) futures price (blue line) for corn. This graph shows that in the last three years the U.S. corn market has experienced high levels of price volatility, ranging from a high of $4.45/bushel on June 17, 2016 to a low of $3.08/bu on September 18, 2018. A merchant could potentially make large losses or large gains in the corn spot market, depending on when specifically the corn was purchased and later sold.</p>

        <p>FIGURE 1-D-1: Corn Futures (blue graph) and ADM Spot Price (red graph) at Decatur, Illinois
        </div>
    
        <p>Recall that the basis is defined as the spot price minus the futures price. Figure 1-D-2 shows the basis within the Decatur corn market. The consistent negative value for the basis primarily reflects the location adjustment that was discussed in Module 1-C. The basis is quite variable and it appears that its movement over time is positively correlated with the spot and futures price movements. This outcome is expected because the price of corn tends to be low when stocks are high and vice versa. High (low) stocks are consistent with a more (less) negative basis because of a higher (lower) cost of storage and a lower (higher) convenience yield. As will be shown below, variation in the basis is an important determinant of the overall effectiveness of a merchant's hedging strategy.</p>

        <p>A simple way to measure price risk facing ADM in the corn market over the April, 2016 - April, 2019 time interval is to calculate the profit and loss for a series of rolling market transactions. Specifically, assume that ADM purchases corn in the spot market on the first trading day of each month and sells that corn two months later (also coinciding with the first trading day). This is done for 34 consecutive months over the April, 2016 - April, 2019 time interval. The mean profit of -$0.026/bu over the 34 trades reveals that the gains and losses largely cancel. The 0.278 standard deviation of profit reveals considerable variability. Figure 1-D-3 shows a graph of the losses and profits on the 34 trades, arranged in order of the least to the most profitable.   </p>
    
        <p>Assume that ADM makes one trade that is randomly drawn from the set of 34. If each trade is equally likely then it follows that ADM faces a 26.47 percent (9/34) chance of experiencing a loss in excess of $0.20/bu, and a 8.82 percent (3/34) chance of experiencing a loss in excess of $0.40/bu. For a company that forward buys and sells millions of bushels of corn each week this level of price risk, if left unhedged, would result in a high level of revenue variability. For a small grain buyer or a local farmer cooperative, this level of price risk could result in financial ruin. Hedging to reduce price risk is therefore a critically important management decision.   </p>

        <p>Price risk is relevant for both sellers and buyers of the commodity. Sellers manage price risk through use of a short hedge and buyers manage price risk through use of a long hedge. The mechanics of each of these hedging mechanisms are discussed in turn.</p>

            <blockquote><font size="4">Short Hedge</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
    
        <p>A short hedge is used by a merchant who owns unpriced commodity (or is precommitted to purchasing the commodity at a previously agreed price) and is worried that the spot price will decrease between when the price is locked in and when the commodity is sold. A common scenario is a grain buyer who has precommitted to purchasing the commodity from a local farmer at a fixed price, and who plans to resell that commodity in two months time to an overseas customer at the spot price which will emerge in two months time.</p>
    
        <br/>

            <p>A short hedge involves taking a short position in the futures market when the price risk begins (e.g., July in the previous example) and offsetting the short position with a long position (i.e., "lifting" the hedge) when the commodity is sold. </p> 
            <p>The short hedge works because gains in the futures market tends to offset losses in the sport market, and vice versa. </p> 
        </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>Figure 1-D-4 provides the data that is needed to analyze a short hedging scenario. On June 1, 2018 ADM signs a forward pricing agreement with a local Decatur, Illinois farmer. The agreement requires the farmer to deliver 5000 bushels of corn on September 28, and upon delivery the farmer will be paid $3.83/bu, which is the current (June 1) spot price. ADM faces price risk because it has committed to purchase the corn at $3.83/bu and it will sell the corn in the Decatur spot market on September 28, possibly at a lower price. To hedge its position, ADM takes a short position (one 5000 bushel contract) on June 1 in the CBOT corn market at price $4.30/bu. According to Figure 1-D-4, when the farmer delivers the corn to ADM on September 28 it will immediately be resold by ADM at a spot price equal to $3.49/bu. On this same day ADM offsets its short futures position by taking a long position at price $3.98/bu.</p>
        <br/>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 700px; background-color: #0404B4;">

                <p>ADM earns 3.49 - 3.83 = -$0.34/bu in the spot market. </p> 
                <p>ADM earns (before commission) 4.30 - 3.98 = $0.32 in the futures market.</p>
                <p>ADM has a net gain (before commission) of -0.34 + 0.32 = -$0.02/bu.</p>

        </div>
    
        <p>The hedge was largely effective because ADM's $0.32/bu gain in the futures market offset most of its $0.34/bu loss in the spot market. If the spot price had increased instead of decreased, then the loss in the futures contract would largely have been offset by the gain in the spot market. An important difference between the two scenarios is that in the first case ADM will receive deposits in its margin account as the gains from futures trading accumulate. In the second case ADM would be required to continually deposit money in its margin account as the losses from futures trading accumulate.</p>
    
        <p>Consider the same short hedging scenario as described above but now assume that the time period is August 14, 2017 to October 13, 2017, and the prices are those which are illustrated in Figure 1-D-5. </p>

            <p>ADM earns 3.22 - 3.63 = -$0.41/bu in the spot market. </p> 
            <p>ADM earns (before commission) 4.27 - 4.15 = $0.12 in the futures market.</p>
            <p>ADM has a net gain (before commission) of -0.41 + 0.12 = -$0.29/bu.</p> 
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>In this case the short hedge was only partially effective because without the hedge the loss is $0.41/bu and with the hedge the loss is $0.29/bu. The difference in effectiveness for the two scenarios is explained below.

        </p>

        
        <p>A long hedge can be illustrated with the price data from Figures 1-D-4 and 1-D-5. In both cases assume that on the initial date (i.e., left side of graph) ADM forward sells corn to a nearby ethanol plant at the prevailing spot price. To fulfill its contractual obligations, ADM will purchase corn in the spot market on the terminal date (i.e., right side of graph) and deliver the corn to the ethanol plant shortly thereafter. ADM is concerned with the negative profits that will result if the spot price of corn increases between the initial and terminal dates. To hedge against this possibility, ADM takes a long futures position on the initial date and offsets this position with a short contract on the terminal date.</p>
        <br/>
    
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 660px; background-color: #0404B4;">
        <div style="position: relative; top: -10px; left: -10px; padding: 10px; background: #CCFFFF; border: 2px solid #0404B4;">
            <p>In the first scenario (Figure 1-D-4) ADM earns 3.83 - 3.49 = $0.34 on the forward contract in the spot market and earns 3.98 - 4.30 = -$0.32/bu in the futures market. The net gain across both markets is $0.02/bu. </p> 
            <p>In the second scenario (Figure 1-D-5) ADM earns 3.63 - 3.22 = $0.41 on the forward contract in the spot market and earns 4.15 - 4.27 = -$0.12/bu in the futures market. The net gain across both markets is $0.29/bu. </p> 
        </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>It is clear that the gains and losses for the long hedger are opposite those of the short hedger. In the long hedge scenario, with the benefit of hindsight, ADM would have preferred to not have a hedge because the spot price dropped. This is an important property of both short and long hedging: hedging reduces the size of a potential loss in profits but it also reduces the size of a potential gain in profits. The analysis above shows that hedging does not fully eliminate the loss or gain in profits that result from unexpected price movements. The determinants of hedging profits for both the short and long hedge is examined next. </p>

        
        <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a004"></a>(iii) Determinants of Profits and Losses from Hedging</h3>
        
        <p>
            <hr align="left" width="50%">
            <blockquote><font size="4">Base Case Analysis</font> </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p> Simple theory can be used to the identify the conditions under which hedging results in positive or negative profits. To make the theory more precise it is necessary to account for the merchant's cost of storage (this was ignored in the previous set of examples). Let  W<sub>0,1</sub> denote the merchant's cost of storing the commodity between when the hedge is initiated and when it is terminated. Let P<sub>0</sub> denote the initial spot price when the hedge is initiated and let P<sub>1</sub> denote the terminal spot price when the hedge is terminated. Similarly, let F<sub>0</sub> denote the initial futures price and let F<sub>1</sub> denote the terminal futures price. 
        
        <p> For the short hedge, combined profits from the spot and futures markets (excluding commission fees) can be expressed as &pi;<sup>S</sup> = (P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>0</sub>) + (F<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>1</sub>) - W<sub>0,1</sub>.  For the long hedge, combined profits can be expressed as &pi;<sup>L</sup> = (P<sub>0</sub> +  W<sub>0,1</sub> - P<sub>1</sub>) + (F<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>0</sub>). The reason why W<sub>0,1</sub> is added to P<sub>0</sub> in the long hedge case is because if the merchant receives the commodity when the hedge is terminated as part of the forward contract rather than purchasing the commodity at the initial date, then the merchant saves paying the storage cost. In a competitive market this storage cost savings is added to P<sub>0</sub> when the forward contract is negotiated.</p> 
            
        <p>The previous set of equations can be rearranged to give &pi;<sup>S</sup> = (P<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>1</sub>) - (P<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>0</sub>) - W<sub>0,1</sub> for the short hedge, and &pi;<sup>L</sup> = -[(P<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>1</sub>) - (P<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>0</sub>) - W<sub>0,1</sub>] for the long hedge. Noting that B<sub>0</sub> = P<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>0</sub> is the initial basis and B<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>1</sub> is the terminal basis it follows from the above equations that:</p>
    
        <br/>
    
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 700px; background-color: #0404B4;">
        <div style="position: relative; top: -10px; left: -10px; padding: 10px; background: #CCFFFF; border: 2px solid #0404B4;">
            <p>Profits from the short hedge equal the change in the basis between when the hedge is placed and when it is lifted minus the storage cost: &pi;<sup>S</sup> = B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - W<sub>0,1</sub> </p> 
            <p>Profits from the long hedge equal the negative of the change in the basis between when the hedge is placed and when it is lifted minus the storage cost: &pi;<sup>L</sup> = -[B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - W<sub>0,1</sub>]</p> 
        </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>This theoretical result is easily confirmed for the case of the short hedge and the set of simulated base case prices from the pricing model. Assume that the trader purchases the corn and places the hedge in Q3, using a futures contract which expires in Q6. The short hedge will be lifted in Q6 when the corn is sold. Finally, suppose that when the Q6 futures contract expires, the basis is equal to L, which is the location adjustment within this market. The left-hand blue shaded columns in Figure 1-D-6 show the base case prices. The futures price from the perspective of the trader prior to Q6 is equal to the Q6 spot price plus the location adjustment, L, which is given by the green shaded rectangle stacked on top of the Q6 blue shaded column. In Q3 when the hedge is placed, the absolute value of the basis is equal to the purple shaded rectangle stacked on top of the Q3 blue shaded rectangle.</p>

        <br/>

            <p>FIGURE 1-D-6: Futures Prices and Basis from Pricing Model
        </div>

        <p>The actual base case prices are as follows. The Q6 spot price is $3.771/bu and the location adjustment, L, is $0.180/bu. Thus, the price of the Q6 futures contract is 3.771 + 0.180 = $3.951/bu for Q1 through Q5. The Q3 spot price is $3.810/bu and the Q3 basis is 3.810 - 3.951 = -0.141/bu. The trader is assume to purchase the corn (or make a forward contract with a farmer) at the Q3 spot price of $3.810 and sell it at the Q6 spot price of $3.771/bu. The profit in the spot market is therefore 3.771 - 3.810 = -$0.039/bu. In this example the trader earns zero profits on the futures market transaction because the futures price does not change between Q3 and Q6. This means that the trader has a combined gross profit equal to -$0.039/bu. Net profits are calculated by subtracting the trader's cost of storage from gross profit. This storage cost may be equal to zero if the hedge involved writing a forward contract with the farmer rather than purchasing and storing the commodity.</p> 
        
        <p>Alternatively, the gross profits earned on the hedge is equal to the change in the basis between when the hedge was placed and when it was lifted. It was previously calculated that the basis when the hedge was placed is equal to -$0.141/bu. In Q6 the basis is equal to the negative of the location adjustment factor, -L = -0.18/bu. Thus, the change in the basis is equal to -0.18 - (-0.141) = -$0.039/bu. As expected, gross profits calculated as the change in the basis is equal to gross profits calculated by summing the profit from the spot market transaction with the profit from the futures market transaction.</p>

        <p>This example does not do a good job at showing the risk reducing properties of the hedge. Indeed, without hedging the trader would have purchase the corn in the spot market in Q3 at price $3.810/bu and sold it in Q6 at $3.771/bu. This transaction would have also resulted in a loss of $0.039/bu. There is no uncertainty in this model and so hedging offers no advantage over remaining unhedged. The next example avoids this over simplification by allowing for an unexpected and unknown announcement in Q1, which generates price uncertainty.</p>

        <p>The orange shaded columns in Figure 1-D-6 show the set of spot prices assuming that year 2 exports surge. The unexpected announcement of the year 2 export surge takes place in Q1, similar to the analysis in Module 1-C. Now assume that the short hedge is placed in Q1 (using the Q6 contract) just prior to the announcement, and it is lifted in Q3, which is when the corn is sold in the spot market. Gross hedging profits are equal to the Q3 basis after the announcement minus the Q1 basis before the announcement.</p> 
            
        <p>Prior to the announcement, the Q6 futures price is equal to $3.951/bu, as was calculated above, and the Q1 spot price is equal to $3.614/bu. Thus, the Q1 basis prior to the announcement is equal to 3.614 - 3.951 = -0.337/bu. After the announcement the Q6 spot price rises to $3.922/bu. Adding on the $0.18/bu location cost implies that after the announcement the Q6 futures price is 3.922 + 0.180 = $4.102/bu. After the announcement the Q3 spot price rises to $3.874/bu, which implies a post announcement basis for Q3 equal to 3.874 - 4.102 = -$0.228/bu. The change in the basis from when the hedge was place in Q1 (prior to the announcement) to when the hedge was lifted in Q3 (after the announcement) is equal to -0.228 - (-0.337)  = $0.109/bu. This value can be interpretted as the gross hedging profits for the short hedger.</p>   

        <p>To calculate net profits for the short trader, an assumption is required about the trader's storage costs. Given the intertemporal law of one price restriction, the two-quarter carrying cost for the market is equal to the difference in the base case prices for Q3 and Q1, which is 3.810 - 3.614 = 0.196. If we assume the storage costs for the trader are equal to the carrying costs for the market then if follows that the net profits for the short hedger are equal to 0.109 - 0.196 = -$0.087/bu. The reason why net hedging profits are negative is because the basis weakened over the hedging period. In this particular case the surge in the futures price that resulted from the announcement was much larger than the surge in the spot price, and thus the basis weakened. The futures price surged by a greater amount because the higher export demand caused the Q6 spot price to rise much more than the Q3 spot price.  </p>

        <p>Despite the negative profits, the short hedge was highly effective at reducing the variability of profits. A full analysis of profit variability with hedging, which allows for both export demand surges and export demand slumps, is presented below.</p>

            <hr align="left" width="50%">
            <blockquote><font size="4">Strengthening and Weakening Basis</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
    
        <p>Based on the previous analysis it should be clear that a short hedger earns positive profits if the basis increases in value over the hedging period, which means becoming either more positive or less negative in value. To avoid confusion, the term <u>strengthening</u> basis refers to a basis that increases in value over time and thus generates positive profits for the short hedger. In contrast, the term <u>weakening</u> basis refers to a basis that decreases in value over time (less positive or more negative) and thus generates negative profits for the short hedger.</p>
    
        <p>It is important to keep in mind that after making the adjustment for location, the basis converges to zero as the futures contract approaches its expiry date. This means that if a basis is expected to strengthen over the hedging period then in order to end up with a value of zero the value of the basis at the start of the hedging period must be less positive or more negative than the value which would generate zero expected gross hedging profits. In other words, if the basis is expected to <u>strengthen</u> over time then the initial basis must be <u>weak</u> relative to the zero gross profit benchmark basis. Similarly, if a basis is expected to <u>weaken</u> over time then the initial value of the basis must be <u>strong</u> (i.e., more positive or less negative relative to the zero gross profit benchmark basis). 
        </p>
    
        
        <p>It is useful to illustrate the connection between the strength of the basis and expected gross profits from hedging. Figure 1-D-7 illustrates the theoretical case where high stocks cause the basis to be weak when the hedge is placed but to strengthen continually over time until the hedge is lifted. For the alternative case where stocks are below the long term average the low cost of storage and high convenience yield would cause the dashed line in Figure 1-D-10 to lie above the solid line. In this case the basis is strong when the hedge is placed but would gradually weaken over time.</p>

        <p>Figure 1-D-7 can be now be used to connect the expected profits of the short and long hedge as a function of whether stocks are above or below their long term average levels. To simplify, assume the unit cost of storage is independent of the level of stocks in the market. Noting that the profitability of the short hedge can be expressed as the  &pi;<sup>S</sup> = B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - W<sub>0,1</sub> it follows that the increase in expected hedging profits in a high stock year relative to long term average profits can be expressed as:</p> 
    
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 900px;border:1px solid red">
            &pi;<sup>S</sup> - &pi;<sup>S,*</sup>= B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - [B<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup> - B<sub>0</sub><sup>*</sup>]
        </div>
    
        <p>This expression can be rewritten as</p>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 900px;border:1px solid red">
            &pi;<sup>S</sup> - &pi;<sup>S,*</sup>= [-B<sub>0</sub> - (B<sub>0</sub><sup>*</sup>)] - [-B<sub>1</sub> - (B<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup>)]
        </div>
    
        <p>Using this latter expression together with Figure 1-D-7 it follows immediately that expected profits for the short hedger in a high stock year are positive relative to long term average profits. The following properties of hedging profits can be derived using logic that is similar to what was used above.</p>

            <p>In a low stock year, the basis is strong when the hedge is placed and it will weaken over time. This results in negative expected profits for the short hedger and positive expected profits for the long hedger. </p>

        <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a005"></a>(iv) Hedging Effectiveness</h3> 
        
        <p>We have seen that hedging can result in positive or negative gross profits, depending on the direction of the change in the size of the basis over the hedging period. The goal of hedging is to eliminate price risk, and so earning a positive profit from the hedge should not be a primary objective. Ideally, we would like the hedge to fully eliminate price risk and in doing so ensure that profits neither increase or decrease. If the trader was interested in earning positive expected profits from price uncertainty, then he or she should be focusing on speculation, and not hedging.   </p>

        <p>A common expression in financial management is that <b>hedging substitutes basis risk for price risk</b>. This makes sense because the expected profits from the hedge depends on whether the basis increases or decreases over the hedging period. Fluctuations in the size of the basis over the hedging period, which is equivalent to basis risk, creates a risky profit flow for the hedger. Thus, while it is true that hedge eliminates price risk by ensuring that gains and losses in the futures market offset losses and gains in the spot market, the hedger still faces uncertain profits due to the basis risk. Figure 1-D-2 shows the high variability of the basis in the U.S. corn market over the period April, 2016 to March, 2019. It is true that this basis risk is less than the underlying price risk but it nevertheless will be a cause of significant concern for hedgers.  </p>

        <p>We can measure the effectiveness of the hedge by measuring the percent reduction in the standard deviation of profit that can be attributed to the hedge. In real world markets, a reduction of 90 percent would be considered very good. In many cases the actual reduction is much lower. The combination of poor hedging effectiveness and the cost of financing margin calls in the futures component of the hedge, is typically the reason why agri-business firms choose not to hedge. This is particularly true when a firm is in a cross hedge situation. An example of a cross hedge is a corn trader in Canada who uses the CME to hedge because there is no Canadian futures market for corn. In this case the basis is the Canadian spot price minus the CME futures price. There are many reasons why the Canadian spot price and the U.S. futures price for corn are only moderately positively correlated (e.g., exchange rate fluctuations). It would not be uncommon to see the level of hedging effectiveness for a Canadian corn trader to be in the range of 40 - 60 percent.</p>

        <p>We can get a good idea of hedging effectiveness by using the pricing model with the year 2 export demand shock. To keep things simple, suppose the short hedge is placed in Q1 and lifted in Q2. A Q3 futures contract is used to create the hedge. Let P<sub>t</sub><sup>b</sup> denote the base case spot price in period t = 1, 2, 3. Let P<sub>t</sub><sup>a</sup> denote the spot price after the announcement in period t = 2, 3. The Q3 futures price is P<sub>3</sub><sup>b</sup> + L before the announcement and P<sub>3</sub><sup>a</sup> + L after the announcement, where L is the adjustment for location. The profits from short hedging can be expressed as the change in the basis:   </p>
        
        <p>Chg Basis = P<sub>2</sub><sup>a</sup> - (P<sub>3</sub><sup>a</sup> + L) - [P<sub>1</sub><sup>b</sup> - (P<sub>3</sub><sup>b</sup> + L)]   </p>

        <p>This reduces to   </p>

        <p>Chg Basis = P<sub>2</sub><sup>a</sup> - P<sub>1</sub><sup>b</sup> - (P<sub>3</sub><sup>a</sup> - P<sub>3</sub><sup>b</sup>)   </p>

        <p>Finally, if we separately evaluate the previous expression for the demand up and demand down scenarios and then calculate the difference, we can write  </p>

        <p>Chg Basis (Demand Up) - Chg Basis (Demand down) = P<sub>2</sub><sup>up</sup> - P<sub>2</sub><sup>down</sup> - (P<sub>3</sub><sup>up</sup> - P<sub>3</sub><sup>down</sup>)   </p>

        <p>We know that gross profits for the short hedger can be measured as the change in basis. This means that the previous equation can be interpreted as the variation in gross hedging profits across the high and low export demand scenarios. In Figure 1-D-8 the value of the previous equation is given by the difference in the heights of the orange and green columns for Q2 versus Q3. This small difference across Q2 and Q3 means there is very little variation in hedging profits as export demand fluctuates. In contrast, in Figure 1-D-8 the variation in the profits for the unhedged trader are given by the variation in the height of the columns in Q2. It should be obvious that hedging has eliminated the Q2 price risk, and what remains is a small amount of basis risk.   </p>

        </div> 
        <br/>   
               
        <p>It is important not to conclude that hedging is always highly effective at eliminating risk. In fact, in some scenarios hedging makes profits more variable. The following scenario highlights this potential outcome. Suppose the trader faces the base case outcome 80 percent of the time. For the remaining 20 percent, suppose the trader faces a high year 2 export demand surge (20% > base case) 10 percent of the time and a low year 2 export demand slump (20% < base case) 10 percent of the time. Similar to Figure 1-D-6, the hedge is placed in Q1, just prior to the Q1 announcement, and lifted in Q3. The futures contract which expires in Q6 is used to create the hedge.    </p>

        <p>The data is as follows. Without an announcement, the spot price is equal to 3.614 and 3.810 in Q1 and Q3, respectively. With the announcement of a year 2 demand surge, the spot price is 3.875 and 3.922 in Q3 and Q6, respectively. With the announcement of a year 2 demand slump, the spot price is 3.766 and 3.670 in Q3 and Q6, respectively. The futures price is calculated by adding the location adjustment of 0.18 to the Q6 spot price. The expressions for calculating the change in basis with the hedge, and the change in the spot price without the hedge, are as follows:  </p>

        <div class=figure>

                alt="FIGURE 1-D-9">
            <p>FIGURE 1-D-9: Calculations for Hedging Effectiveness
        </div> 
        <br/>

        <p>The first step is to calculate expected gross profits with and without the hedge.  Recall that there is an 80 percent chance of no announcement, a 10 percent chance of a price surge announcement and a 10 percent chance of a price slump announcement. With these probabilities and the conditional profits from Figure 1-D-9, it can be shown that expected gross profits equal $0.198/bu without the hedge, and $0.193/bu with the hedge. In this particular case the hedger does not have an expected profit incentive to either pursue the hedge or avoid the hedge. </p>

        <p> The variance of profits without the hedge can be calculated as:</p>
        <p>Variance (no hedge) = 0.8(0.196 - 0.198)^2 + 0.1(0.261-0.198)^2 + 0.1(0.151 - 0.198)^2   </p>
        <p>The variance of profits with the hedge can be calculated as: </p>
        <p> Variance (hedge) = 0.8(0.196 - 0.193)^2 + 0.1(0.110-0.193)^2 + 0.1(0.253 - 0.193)^2 </p>
        <p>After evaluating these expressions and taking the square root to convert variance into standard deviation, it can be shown that the standard deviation of profits is equal to 0.0247 without the hedge and 0.0325 with the hedge. This result that hedging can increase rather than decrease the variability of profits was not expected but it can be easily explained. Without the hedge, the profits of the trader do not depend on the Q6 pricing outcome. With the hedge, the trader's profits fall sharply when there is an export demand surge due to large losses on the short futures position. Conversely, the trader's profits rise rapidly when there is an export demand slump due to a large gain in the futures market. The comparatively large swings in the Q6 futures price raises the trader's profits with a hedge above that without the hedge. Keep in mind that this outcome is not particularly realistic because we would not generally expect a trader to use a Q6 contract to hedge when the hedging period runs from Q1 to Q3.  </p>

        <br/>
        <p>For the two assignment questions in Module 1-D you will use Bloomberg daily corn futures and spot price <a href="bloomberg_corn_data.xlsx">data</a>.</p> 
            
        <p>Use the prices in this data set to answer questions 1 and 2 below.</p> 

    <ol start="1">
    
        <li><p>Assume you manage a Cargill grain buying elevator near Decatur, Illinois. You purchased corn from a local farmer on date t1 and will sell it to a local ethanol plant on date t2. You paid the farmer the spot price that was reported on date t1. When you sell the corn on date t2 you will receive the spot price that is reported for that day. Assume that t1 is the day nearest to your birthday in 2017, and t2 is six months later, adjusted to the nearest trading day.</p> 
        
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Identify t1 and t2 in your particular case. In order to hedge your spot market exposure, what futures market position will take on date t1? When will you offset that position?</li>
            <li>Construct a table that shows the profit/loss you made in the spot market and in the futures market. Use this table to calculate your gross profits/loss from your hedge position.</li>
            <li>Calculate the basis on dates t1 and t2. Demonstrate that the change in the basis is equal to the gross profits/loss from the hedge, which you calculated in part b.</li>
            <li>Calculate your profit/loss in the spot market if you did not hedge. How does your gross profits/loss with the hedge compare with your profit/loss if you did not hedge? Should these values be either both positive or both negative? Or can one be positive and one be negative? Briefly explain.</li>
        </ol>
        
       </li>
       <br/>
       <li><p>Module 1.D emphasized that hedging does not fully eliminate the variance in profits if the basis fluctuates over time. If a manager wants to minimize the variance of net hedging profits then the fraction of the spot market position that is hedged should be scaled back to account for fluctuations in the basis. The optimal fraction to hedge is referred to as the minimum variance hedging ratio. You can read about it <a href="https://financetrain.com/minimum-variance-hedge-ratio/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p> 
        
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Using the data that you downloaded, calculate the day-to-day change in the spot and futures price series.</li>
            <li>Calculate the standard deviation of the spot and future price changes. Calculate the correlation between the spot and future price changes.</li>
            <li>Use your results from part (c) together with the formula from the minimum variance hedge reading (see above) to calculate the minimum variance hedge ratio for corn.</li>
