        <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a001"></a>(i) Introduction</h3>
    
        <p>As previously noted, a key role of a commodity futures market is hedging by merchants who operate in the spot market and wish to minimize price risk. Farmers can hedge by signing forward contracts with a commodity merchant such as Cargill or a farmer-owned cooperative. Once the forward contract is signed the merchant faces price risk because the price that will be paid to the farmer in the future is locked in but the price the merchant will receive when the commodity is resold is uncertain. The merchant can use a <u>short</u> hedge to minimize this price risk. Suppose instead that a flour mill uses a forward contract to lock in the price of flour that is to be delivered to a large scale bakery in three months time. The flour mill is concerned that the price of its key ingredient, wheat, will rise between when the price of flour is locked in and when the wheat is purchased in the spot market. The flour mill can use a <u>long</u> hedge to minimize this price risk.</p>
    
        <p>The analysis and results for the short and long hedge are mirrow images of each other. For example, if price moves in a way that results in a $0.16/bu loss for the short hedger, then that same price movement will result in a $0.16/bu gain for the long hedger. For this reason in Section (iii) of this module, which shows simulated profits and losses from hedging, the focus is on the short hedger, and it is left to the reader to work out the analogous results for the long hedger.</p>
    
        <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a002"></a>(ii) Price Risk Case Study</h3>
    
        <p>To illustrate the price risk in the U.S. corn market daily spot prices were collected for a three year period: April 29, 2016 to April 26, 2019. The spot prices are the farm-level bid prices on offer by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) at their Decatur, Illinois grain collection facility. As was previously illustrated in Figure 1-C-2, the ADM bid prices are constructed by adding a basis that is specific to Decatur, Illinois to the price of the nearest futures contract. New futures contracts replace expiring futures contracts on an on-going basis. The data was downloaded from the Bloomberg terminal on April 29, 2019.</p>
    
        <p>Figure 1-D-1 is a graph of the ADM spot price (red line) and the CBOT (nearest to expiry) futures price (blue line) for corn. This graph shows that in the last three years the U.S. corn market has experienced high levels of price volatility, ranging from a high of $4.45/bushel on June 17, 2016 to a low of $3.08/bu on September 18, 2018. A merchant could potentially make large losses or large gains in the corn spot market, depending on the specific dates when a position in the market is initiated and later terminated.</p>

        </div>
    
        <p>Recall that the basis is defined as thes spot price minus the futures price. Figure 1-D-2 shows the basis within the Decatur corn market. The consistent negative value for the basis primarily reflects the location adjustment that was discussed in the previous module. The basis is quite variable but it is fairly evident that its movement over time is positively correlated with the spot and futures price movements. This outcome is expected because the price of corn tends to be low when stocks are high and vice versa. High (low) stocks are consistent with a more (less) negative basis because of a higher (lower) cost of storage and a lower (higher) convenience yield. As will be shown below, variation in the basis is an important determinant of the overall effectiveness of a merchant's hedging strategy.</p>

        <p>A simple way to measure price risk facing ADM in the corn market over the April, 2016 - April, 2019 time interval is to calculate the profit and loss for a series of rolling market transactions. Specifically, assume that ADM purchases corn in the spot market on the first trading day of each month and sells that corn two months later (also coinciding with the first trading day). This is done for 34 consecutive months over the April, 2016 - April, 2019 time interval. The mean profit of -$0.026/bu over the 34 trades reveals that the gains and losses largely cancel. The 0.278 standard deviation of profit reveals considerable variability. Figure 1-D-3 shows a graph of the losses and profits on the 34 trades, arranged in order of the most negative to the most positive profits from the trade.   </p>
    
        <p>Assume that ADM makes one trade that is randomly drawn from the set of 34. If each trade is equally likely then it follows that ADM faces a 26.47 percent (9/34) chance of receiving a loss in excess of $0.20/bu, and a 8.82 percent (3/34) chance of receiving a loss in excess of $0.40/bu. For a company that forward buys and sells millions of bushels of corn each week this level of price risk, if left unhedged, would result in a high level of revenue variability. For a small grain buyer or a local farmer cooperative, this level of price risk could result in financial ruin. Hedging to reduce price risk is undoubtedly a critically important management decision.   </p>

        <p>Price risk is relevant for both sellers and buyers of the commodity. Sellers manage price risk through use of a short hedge and buyers manage price risk through use of a long hedge. The mechanics of each of these hedging mechanisms are discussed in turn.</p>

            <blockquote><font size="4">Short Hedge</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
    
        <p>A short hedge is used by a merchant who owns unpriced commodity (or is precommitted to purchasing the commodity at a previously agreed price) and is worried that the spot price will decrease between when the price is locked in and when the commodity is sold. A common scenario is a grain buyer who provides a farmer with a forward contract and a locked-in purchase price prior to harvest (e.g., July), and will accept delivery of the commodity and then sold to an overseas customer after harvest is complete (e.g., November).</p>
    
        <br/>
    
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 700px; background-color: #0404B4;">
        <div style="position: relative; top: -10px; left: -10px; padding: 10px; background: #CCFFFF; border: 2px solid #0404B4;">
            <p>A short hedge involves taking a short position in the futures market when the price risk begins (e.g., July in the previous example) and offsetting the short position with a long position (i.e., "lifting" the hedge) when the commodity is sold. </p> 
            <p>The short hedge works because gains in the futures market tends to offset losses in the sport market, and vice versa. </p> 
        </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>Figure 1-D-4 provides the data that is needed to analyze a short hedging scenario. On June 1, 2018 ADM signs a forward pricing agreement with a local Decatur, Illinois farmer. The agreement requires the farmer to deliver 5000 bushels of corn at the end of September and upon delivery the farmer will be paid $3.83/bu, which is the current (June 1) spot price. ADM faces price risk because it has committed to purchase the corn at $3.83/bu and it will sell the corn in the Decatur spot market in late September, possibly at a lower price. To hedge its position, on June 1, 2018 ADM takes a short position (one 5000 bushel contract) in the CBOT corn market at price $4.30/bu. Suppose the farmer delivers the corn to ADM in late September and ADM sells the corn in the Decatur spot market on September 28, 2018 at price $3.49/bu (see right side of Figure 1-D-4). On this same day ADM offsets its short futures position by taking a long position at price $3.98/bu.</p>
        <br/>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 700px; background-color: #0404B4;">

                <p>ADM earns 3.49 - 3.83 = -$0.34/bu in the spot market. </p> 
                <p>ADM earns (before commission) 4.30 - 3.98 = $0.32 in the futures market.</p>
                <p>ADM has a net gain (before commission) of -0.34 + 0.32 = -$0.02/bu.</p> 
        </div>

                <p>FIGURE 1-D-4: ADM Short Hedge with Mostly Offsetting Gains and Losses
        </div>
    
        <p>The hedge was largely effective because ADM's $0.32/bu gain in the futures market offset most of its $0.34/bu loss in the spot market. If the spot price had increased instead of decreased, then the loss in the futures contract would largely have been offset by the gain in the spot market. An important difference between the two scenarios is that in the first case ADM will receive deposits in its margin account as the gains from futures trading accumulate. In the second case ADM would be required to continually deposit money in its margin account as the losses from futures trading accumulate.</p>
    
        <p>Consider the same short hedging scenario as described above but now assume that the time period is August 14, 2017 to October 13, 2017, and the prices are those which are illustrated in Figure 1-D-5. </p>
        <br/>

            <p>ADM earns 3.22 - 3.63 = -$0.41/bu in the spot market. </p> 
            <p>ADM earns (before commission) 4.27 - 4.15 = $0.12 in the futures market.</p>
            <p>ADM has a net gain (before commission) of -0.41 + 0.12 = -$0.29/bu.</p> 
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>In this case the short hedge was only partially effective because without the hedge the loss is $0.41/bu and with the hedge the loss is $0.29/bu. The difference in effectiveness for the two scenarios is explained below.

            <blockquote><font size="4">Long Hedge</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
    
        <p>A long hedge can be illustrated with the price data from Figures 1-D-4 and 1-D-5. In both cases assume that on the initial date (i.e., left side of graph) ADM forward sells corn to a nearby ethanol plant for the prevailing spot price. To fulfil its contractual obligations, ADM will purchase corn in the spot market on the terminal date (i.e., right side of graph) and deliver the corn to the ethanol plant shortly thereafter. ADM is concerned with the negative profits that it will incur if the spot price of corn increases between the initial and terminal dates. To hedge against this possibility, ADM takes a long futures position on the initial date and offsets this position with a short contract on the terminal date.</p>
        <br/>
    
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 660px; background-color: #0404B4;">
        <div style="position: relative; top: -10px; left: -10px; padding: 10px; background: #CCFFFF; border: 2px solid #0404B4;">
            <p>In the first scenario (Figure 1-D-4) ADM earns 3.83 - 3.49 = $0.34 on the forward contract in the spot market and earns 3.98 - 4.30 = -$0.32/bu in the futures market. The net gain across both markets is $0.02/bu. </p> 
            <p>In the second scenario (Figure 1-D-5) ADM earns 3.63 - 3.22 = $0.41 on the forward contract in the spot market and earns 4.15 - 4.27 = -$0.12/bu in the futures market. The net gain across both markets is $0.29/bu. </p> 
        </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>It is clear that the gains and losses for the long hedger are opposite thos of the short hedger. In the long hedge scenario, with the benefit of hindsight, ADM would have preferred to not have a hedge because the spot price dropped. This is an important property of both short and long hedging: hedging reduces the size of a potential loss in profits but it also reduces the size of a potential gain in profits. The analysis above shows that hedging does not fully eliminate the loss or gain in profits that result from unexpected price movements. The determinants of hedging profits for both the short and long hedge is examined next. </p>
    
        <p>
            <hr align="left" width="50%">
            <blockquote><font size="4">Determinants of Profits and Losses from Hedging</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
        
        <p> Simple theory can be used to the identify the conditions under which hedging results in positive or negative profits. To make the theory more precise it is necessary to account for the merchant's cost of storage (this was ignored in the previous set of examples). Let  W<sub>0,1</sub> denote the merchant's cost of storing the commodity between when the hedge is initiated and when it is terminated. Let P<sub>0</sub> denote the initial spot price when the hedge is initiated and let P<sub>1</sub> denote the terminal spot price when the hedge is terminated. Similarly, let Let F<sub>0</sub> denote the initial futures price and let F<sub>1</sub> denote the terminal futures price. 
        
        <p> For the short hedge, combined profits from the spot and futures markets (excluding commission fees) can be expressed as &pi;<sup>S</sup> = (P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>0</sub>) + (F<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>1</sub>) - W<sub>0,1</sub>.  For the long hedge, combined profits can be expressed as &pi;<sup>L</sup> = (P<sub>0</sub> +  W<sub>0,1</sub> - P<sub>1</sub>) + (F<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>0</sub>). The reason why W<sub>0,1</sub> is added to P<sub>0</sub> in the long hedge case is because if the merchant receives the commodity when the hedge is terminated as part of the forward contract rather than purchasing the commodity at the initial date, then the merchant saves paying the storage cost. In a competitive market this storage cost savings is added to P<sub>0</sub> when the forward contract is negotiated.</p> 
            
        <p>The previous set of equations can be rearranged to give &pi;<sup>S</sup> = (P<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>1</sub>) - (P<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>0</sub>) - W<sub>0,1</sub> and &pi;<sup>L</sup> = -[(P<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>1</sub>) - (P<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>0</sub>) - W<sub>0,1</sub>]. Noting that B<sub>0</sub> = P<sub>0</sub> - F<sub>0</sub> is the initial basis and B<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>1</sub> - F<sub>1</sub> is the terminal basis it follows from the above equations that:</p>
    
        <br/>
    
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 700px; background-color: #0404B4;">
        <div style="position: relative; top: -10px; left: -10px; padding: 10px; background: #CCFFFF; border: 2px solid #0404B4;">
            <p>Profits from the short hedge equal the change in the basis between when the hedge is placed and when it is lifted minus the storage cost: &pi;<sup>S</sup> = B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - W<sub>0,1</sub> </p> 
            <p>Profits from the long hedge equal the negative of the change in the basis between when the hedge is placed and when it is lifted minus the storage cost: &pi;<sup>L</sup> = -[B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - W<sub>0,1</sub>]</p> 
        </div>
        </div>
    
        <p>This theoretical result is easily confirmed for the case of the short hedge and the set of prices that are illustrated in Figures 1-D-4 and 1-D-5 (assume storage costs are equal to zero). In Figure 1-D-4, the initial basis is B<sub>0</sub> = 3.83 - 4.30 = -0.47 and the terminal basis is B<sub>1</sub> = 3.49 - 3.98 = -0.49. The change in the basis is B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> = -0.49 - (-0.47) = -0.02. In Figure 1-D-5, the initial basis is B<sub>0</sub> = 3.63 - 4.27 = -0.64 and the terminal basis is B<sub>1</sub> = 3.22 - 4.15 = -0.93. The change in the basis is B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> = -0.93 - (-0.64) = -0.29. These values are the same as the hedging losses that were previously calculated. The examples are therefore consistent with the theory. </p>
    
        <p>The basis is a stochastic variable similar to the spot price and the futures price. It should be clear that hedging eliminates the risk of a changing spot price and instead leaves the merchant with the risk of a changing basis. As Figure 1-C-10 illustrates, there was substantial variability in the basis in the U.S. corn market during the April, 2016 to April, 2019 time interval. This variability in the basis reduced the effectiveness of both short and long hedging during this period by a significant amount. It should be noted that basis risk also affects farmers who lock in a price using a forward contract rather than using futures contracts. Recall that the spot price offered to the farmer is the current futures price plus the basis. For a given contract the farmer faces no uncertainty because the price is locked in but year-to-year the farmer faces both uncertainty in the futures price and uncertainty in the basis.</p>
    
        <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a004"></a>(iv) Expected Profits from Hedging</h3>
    
        <p>The purpose of this section is to use the simulation results from the previous module to examine how the basis is expected to change across the different seasons of the marketing year and with different levels of seasonally-adjusted stocks. Identifying the expected changes in the basis allows the expected profits of the hedge to be fully identified.</p>

            <blockquote><font size="4">Strengthening and Weakening Basis</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
    
        <p>Based on the previous analysis it should be clear that a short hedger earns positive profits if the basis increases in value over the hedging period, which means becoming either more positive or less negative in value. To avoid confusion, the term <u>strengthening</u> basis refers to a basis that increases in value over time and thus generates positive profits for the short hedger. In contrast, the term <u>weakening</u> basis refers to a basis that decreases in value over time (less positive or more negative) and thus generates negative profits for the short hedger.</p>
    
        <p>It is important to keep in mind that after making the adjustment for location, the basis converges to zero as the futures contract approaches its expiry date. This means that if a basis is expected to strengthen over the hedging period then in order to end up with a value of zero the value of the basis at the start of the hedging period must be relatively small (i.e., less positive or more negative than the value which would generate zero expected gross hedging profits). In other words, if the basis is expected to <u>strengthen</u> over time then the initial basis must be <u>weak</u> relative to the zero gross profit benchmark basis. Similarly, if a basis is expected to <u>weaken</u> over time then the initial value of the basis must be <u>strong</u> (i.e., more positive or less negative relative to the zero gross profit benchmark basis).

            <blockquote><font size="4">Simulated Determinants of Hedging Profits</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
    
        <p>It is important to keep in mind that profits from hedging depends on how the basis changes over time rather than whether the basis is positive or negative when the hedge is placed. In the simulation results that were presented in the previous module it was shown that the basis is generally positive at the Gulf Coast and is generally negative at Kansas City. Even though the spot price is lower in the Kansas City market than in the Gulf Coast market, this price difference does not matter for hedging profits unless it changes over time. It turns out that the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price difference does change over time and this change is an important determinant of hedging profits.</p>
    
        <p>Figure 1-D-6 is a copy of Figure 1-C-6 from the previous module. Specifically, Figure 1-D-6 assumes the hedger is located at the Gulf Coast, and the year 1 carry over is positive because the potential for a year 2 is loss is large. The positive carry over of stocks results in a positive slope of the forward curve and a basis that continually becomes more positive over the 8 quarters of the simulation model. Consequently, gross hedging profits are positive regardless of when the hedge is initially placed (i.e., Q2 versus Q3 versus Q4. The cost of the hedge, which primarily consists of the cost of holding the stocks over the hedging period, must be subtracted from gross hedging profits to arrive at net hedging profits.</p>

            </div>
    
        <p>Recall that the price spread in the forward curve reflects the expected change in the basis across the dates of the spread given the assumption of normal price expectations. In Figure 1-D-6 suppose the hedge is placed in Q4 and lifted in Q6. The direct way to measure gross hedging profits is to subtract the Q4 basis from the Q6 basis. The indirect way to measure gross hedging profits is to measure the price spread on the forward curve between Q4 and Q6. In the first case one must observe how the basis changes over time in order to determine hedging profits whereas in the second case expected profits are implied by the slope of the forward curve at the beginning of the hedging period. In real world hedging analysis it is not common to measure hedging profits using price spreads from the forward curve because generally the futures prices which appear in the forward curve do not correspond to the beginning and end of the hedging period.</p>
    
        <p>Tables 1-D-1 and 1-D-2 decompose gross hedging profits in the Kansas City market into two components: (1) the bit that is due to a reduction in the carrying cost and the bit that is due to a reduction in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount. Table 1-D-1 corresponds to the carryover scenario, and Table 1-D-2 corresponds to the stockout scenario. The left-hand set of columns contain measures of the prices (Q2, Q3 and Q4) and expected prices (Q6). Within these columns, the values in the top two rows are the simulated Gulf Coast spot prices and carrying charges, the latter calculated beginning when the hedge was placed and ending in Q7, which is when the futures contract expires. Summing the values in these two rows gives the expected value of the Q7 Gulf Coast spot price ($4.126/bu). After subtracting from this value the the Q7 Gulf Coast - Chicago price discount ($0.345/bu in the third row) the result is the expected Q7 Chicago spot price ($3.781/bu). With the assumption of normal price expectations and price convergence, the the expected Q7 Chicago spot price is the equilibrium value of a F7 futures contract, which remains constant over the Q2 to Q6 hedging period. The $3.781/bu futures price is reported in the fourth row of Tables 1-D-1 and 1-D-2. Now calculate the Kansas City spot prices by subtracting the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discounts in the fifth row from the Gulf Coast Spot prices in the top row. The resulting set of Kansas City spot prices (sixth row) minus the $3.781 price of the F7 futures contract gives the basis for Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q6 (seventh row).</p>

        </div>
    
        <p>The right columns in Tables 1-D-1 and 1-D-2 show the price reductions across the hedging periods. The most important rows are the second, which show the reduction in the carrying cost, the fifth, which show the reduction in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount, and the seventh, which show the negative of the change in the Kansas City basis. By construction, the reduction in the carrying charge, which raises the Kansas City spot price relative to the futures price, and the reduction in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount, which also raises the Kansas City spot relative to the futures price, comprises the total increase in the basis. Thus, the sum of the values in the second and fifth rows equal the negative of the change in the basis. These values with the opposite sign, which are a measure of gross hedging profits, are reported in the bottom right corner of Tables 1-D-1 and 1-D-2.</p>
    
        <p> Table 1-D-1 shows that for the case of a positive carry over of stock, gross hedging profits are larger the longer the hedging period (e.g., $0.302/bu for a Q2 - Q6 hedge, and $0.099/bu for a Q4 - Q6 hedge). This is an expected result. However, notice that if the hedge is placed in Q3 and lifted in Q6, gross hedging profits are reduced from $0.215/bu to $0.166/bu (a loss of 22.8 percent) due to the unfavourable movement in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount. The percentage loss is even larger for a hedge that is placed in Q4 and lifted in Q6 (hedging profits are reduced from $0.146/bu to $0.099/bu, which is 32.2 percent). Without information on the cost of the hedge, which will increase with a longer hedging period due to a higher cost of storage, it is not possible to calculate net hedging profits. However, if the hedger's carrying cost is at least as large as the market's carrying cost, then the results from Table 1-D-1 imply negative net profits for the Kansas City hedger in the carry over scenario.</p>

        <p> Table 1-D-2 shows the same results as Table 1-D-1 except now the year 1 market stocks out rather than carries over positive stock to year 2 (this is due to the smaller potential loss in the year 2 harvest). The main difference is that because of the price inversion that results from the stockout, gross hedging profits are smaller rather than larger for longer hedging periods. The change in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount is the same in the two tables and thus the difference in results is entirely attributable to the difference in the change in carrying costs over time. Notice that the Gulf Coast and Kansas City spot prices in Q6 is greater than the corresponding price in Q2 and less than the corresponding price in Q4. This ensures the change in the basis is positive if the hedge is place in Q2 and negative if it is placed in Q4. The decrease in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount reduces gross hedging profits in all hedging scenarios. The end results is positive gross hedging profits if the hedge is placed in Q2 and negative profits if it is placed in either Q3 or Q4. In this latter case, net hedging profits are unambiguously negative.</p>

        <p>The gross profits for a hedger in the Gulf Coast spot market are presented for the carryover case (Table 1-D-3) and the stockout case (Table 1-D-4). Similar to the Kansas City market outcome, the carrying charge is positive and increases with the length of the hedging period in the carry over case and is initially positive but decreases to a negative value in the stock out case. In the Gulf Coast market there are no offsetting negative changes in the price discounts to reduce gross hedging profits. Thus, the change in the carrying charge is equal to gross hedging profits. The change in the Gulf Coast - Chicago price discount over the Q2 through Q4 period does not affect hedging profits for both the Kansas City and Gulf Coast hedger because the hedge is lifted in Q6 in all scenarios. If the hedger could select which quarter to lift then hedge then the change in the Gulf Coast - Kansas City price discount would affect hedging profits in both Kansas City and the Gulf Coast.</p>

        </p>
    
        <p>Earlier in this module the concept of a weak basis that strengthens over time and a strong basis that weakens over time was introduced. The connection between this concept and expected gross profits from hedging can now be fully specified. Figure 1-D-7 illustrates the theoretical case where high stocks cause the basis to be weak when the hedge is placed but to strengthen continually over time until the hedge is lifted. The basis takes on negative values because the transportation cost from the spot market to the Gulf Coast market is assumed to be large (e.g., Kansas City scenario). The diagram for the case of a positive basis, which is attributable to a relatively small transportation cost from the spot market to the Gulf Coast market, would look similar except the two upward sloping schedules would lie above the horizonal axis. For the alternative case where stocks are below the long term average the low cost of storage and high convenience yield would cause the dashed line in Figure 1-D-10 to lie above the solid line. In this case the basis is strong when the hedge is placed but would gradually weaken over time.</p>

        <br/>
    
        <p>Figure 1-D-7 can be now be used to connect the expected profits of the short and long hedge as a function of whether stocks are above or below their long term average levels. To simplify, assume the unit cost of storage is indepenent of the level of stocks in the market. Noting that the profitability of the short hedge can be expressed as the  &pi;<sup>S</sup> = B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - W<sub>0,1</sub> it follows that the increase in expected hedging profits in a high stock year relative to long term average profits can be expressed as:</p> 
    
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 900px;border:1px solid red">
            &pi;<sup>S</sup> - &pi;<sup>S,*</sup>= B<sub>1</sub> - B<sub>0</sub> - [B<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup> - B<sub>0</sub><sup>*</sup>]
        </div>
    
        <p>This expression can be rewritten as</p>
        <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 900px;border:1px solid red">
            &pi;<sup>S</sup> - &pi;<sup>S,*</sup>= [-B<sub>0</sub> - (B<sub>0</sub><sup>*</sup>)] - [-B<sub>1</sub> - (B<sub>1</sub><sup>*</sup>)]
        </div>
    
        <p>Using this latter expression together with Figure 1-D-7 it follows immediately that expected profits for the short hedger in a high stock year are positive relative to long term average profits. The following properties of hedging profits can be derived using logic that is similar to what was used above.</p>

            <blockquote><font size="4">Backwardation and Contango: Traditional View</font> </blockquote>
        </p>
    
        <p>Throughout the previous analysis we have assumed that the futures price is an unbiased forecast of the up-and-coming spot price. This assumption is referred to as <u> normal expectations</u>. An alternative theory proposed by Keynes in 1930 is referred to as <u> normal backwardation</u>. Keynes believed that risk averse short hedgers pay a premium to speculators as a way to compensate speculators for accepting price risk. The premium is paid implicitly by virtue of a futures price that is biased downward. Keynes believed that with an unbiased futures price the hedger's demand for short futures contract will exceed the speculator's demand for long futures contracts. Equilibrium is achieved when the futures price is bid down to ensure that the demand for short contracts is equal to the demand for long contracts. The downward <i>hedging pressure</i> results in an expected profit for speculators and an expected loss for hedgers.</p>
    
        <p>The opposite of backwardation is contango. In this case there is an excess demand for long contracts by speculators, and this excess demand bids the current futures price above the futures price that traders believe will prevail when the futures contract expires. The excess demand for long positions may emerge for a number of reasons, including the passive demand by hedge funds and other institutional investors for the purpose of diversifying their overall financial portfolios. With contango short hedgers expect to earn a positive profit because the initial futures price is relatively high when the short position is initiated and the expiring futures price is relatively low when the short position is offset.</p> 
            
        <p>Backwardation and contango can be illustrated in two alternative ways. First, for a particular futures contract, with backwardation (contango) the expected futures price increases (decreases) over time and the bias gradually diminishes until it reaches zero when the futures contract expires. Second, at a particular point in time backwardation and contango affects the price spreads in the forward curve. Figure 1-D-8 shows the first way for the case of backwardation. Notice that the initial basis is strong and it weakens over time relative to the case of normal price expectations. It therefore follows that a short hedger expects negative expected profits if the market is characterized by backwardation. Figure 1-D-9 is the same as Figure 1-D-8 except it assumes there is contango rather than backwardation. In this case the initial basis is weak and it is expected to strengthen over time relative to the case of normal price expectations. Now the short hedger expects to earn positive profits.</p>

        <p>To illustrate backwardation and contango with the forward curve it is useful to return to the simulation results for the case of a Gulf Coast hedger in a market with year 1 carry over. Figure 1-D-10 is the same as Figure 1-D-6 except the forward curve has pivoted down due to backwardation (without backwardation the forward curve would connect the tops of the solid coloured columns). The striped columns show the height of the backwardated forward curve from the perspective of the hedger in Q4. Notice that the price of the F7 curve is biased down the most and there is no downward bias for the expiring F4 contract. In other words, the backwardation has flattened the forward curve. The horizontal dashed line shows the futures price in Q4 and thus defines the Q4 basis. Notice that the basis is much larger (i.e., more positive) than what would be the case with normal price expectations. The strong initial basis implies that the basis weakens over time relative to the case of normal price expectations. In fact, Figure 1-D-10 shows that the basis is approximately the same in Q4 when the hedge is placed as it is in Q7 when the hedge is lifted. Relative to the case of normal price expectations where the basis increases in value over time, the hedger should expect negative profits.</p>

            <blockquote><font size="4">Backwardation and Contango: Modern View</font> </blockquote>
        </p>  
    
        <p>The second (modern) interpretation of backwardation and contango is that these concepts refer to a situation where a temporary shortage or surplus of the commodity has caused the price to rise above or fall below the equilibrium price, and traders anticipate that the price will gradually regain equilibrium. In a backwardated (contango) market, the forward curve slopes down (up) because with the gradual elimination of the commodity shortage (surplus), the spot and futures price are expected to gradually decrease (increase) over time. With this interpretation of backwardation and contango traders have normal price expectations because the spot and futures price are expected to move in the same direction in response to the temporary shortfall or surplus. In summary, the classic and modern interpretations of backwardation and contango both give rise to a sloped forward curve but the reasons for the slope are very different.</p>
    
        <p>The modern interpretation of backwardation can be illustated using results from the simulation model, assuming the Gulf Coast market with a year 1 stockout. Begin by changing the values of the parameters which define the cost of carry schedule. Specifically, replace m<sub>0</sub> = 0.05 with m<sub>0</sub> = 0.04 and replace m<sub>1</sub> = 0.005 with m<sub>1</sub> = 0.008. This change implies a larger convenience yield for merchants who hold stock. Assuming that the market stocks out, the equilibrium Gulf Coast spot prices for the first four quarters are as follows:
        P1 = 3:664, P2 = 3:706, P3 = 3:720 and P4 = 3:707. Notice that the price increases from Q1
        through Q3 and then decreases from Q3 to Q4. This occurs because as stocks diminish toward
        the end of the marketing year the carrying cost switches from a positive to a negative value due to the rising convenience yield.</p> 
        
        <p>In the previous example, the forward curves slopes up for Q1 through Q3 and slopes down for Q3 to Q4. According to the modern interpretation of backwardation the downward sloping forward curve when moving from Q3 to Q4 is evidence of backwardation. Specifically, traders will understand that the shortage of commodity in Q4 is temporarily driving up convenience yield, which in turn is driving up Q4 spot price of the commodity. When new stocks arrive and the convenience yield declines, the spot price will also decline. Thus, the forward curve slopes down even while maintaining the assumption of normal price expectations for traders. When modeling commodity prices with normal price expectations in the first part of this paper, a high convenience yield which causes the forward curve to slope down would be described as an inverted market and not a backwardated market. </p>
