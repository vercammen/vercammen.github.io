    <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a001"></a>(i) What is a Commodity Futures Market?</h3>

    <p>Commodity futures markets have two main purposes: (1) price discovery; and (2) risk transfer. These two features will be examined in this module. We will focus on storable commodities such as palm oil and wheat. This is important because for a storable commodity today's price and the price we expect in the future move together over time. A futures price is the market's best estimate of the future cash (spot) price of the commodity after adjusting for transportation costs. For example, on January 29, 2019 a Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) soybean contract that expires in March, 2019 was trading at US $9.19/bu. This means that as of January 19, the traders' best estimate of the up-and-coming March cash price of soybeans in Chicago is US $9.19/bu.</p>

    <p>If you trade commodity futures (e.g., CME sugar) you must decide if you will take a long or short position. Although long is equivalent to "buy" and short is equivalent to "sell", you are not actually buying or selling anything when you enter the contract. This is different than when buy or sell a stock such Rogers or Bombardier on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE).</p>

            <p> <b>Short Position</b>: A commitment to deliver (sell) at a pre-specified future date and price.</p>        
                <p> <b>Long Position</b>: A commitment to accept delivery (buy) at a pre-specified future date and price. </p>           
        </div>
    </div>

    <br/>

    <p>Before examining price discovery and risk transfer in detail we will focus on the institutional characteristics of trading commodity futures. We will begin by defining a forward contract and then explain the main differences between a forward contract and a futures contract.</p> 

    <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a002"></a>(ii) Futures vs. Forward Contract</h3>

    <p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forwardcontract.asp" target="_blank">Investopedia </a> defines a forward contract as:</p>   

    <p>"A customized contract between two parties to buy or sell a (commodity) at a specified price on a future date."</p> 

    <p> Most forward contracts are held by the original buyer and seller until the transaction is completed (i.e., the seller delivers the commodity to the buyer and then is paid the previously agreed-upon price). A common type of forward contract is a <i>deferred delivery contract</i>. Check out the description of this type of contract which is offered by 
        <a href= "https://www.viterra.com/documents/48315/312425/DeferredDeliveryContractFactSheet.pdf/7832d616-4a0d-4214-bcfc-2bcd32e00aa9"target="_blank">Viterra </a>, which is a major grain buyer in western Canada.</p>
        
    <p>A commodity futures contract is the same as a forward contract except for four important differences:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The contracts trade in centralized exchanges rather than being negotiated by two parties in a decentralized location;</li>
        <li> The contracts are standardized (e.g., the same delivery date and quantity to be delivered);</li>
        <li> Each contract has a buyer (long) and a seller (short), but the exchange clearing house serves as an intermediary; and</li> 
        <li> Contracts are typically offset, which means that when the delivery date there is no physical exchange of the commodity between the current seller and buyer.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Each of these four differences are discussed in turn.</p>

    <p>Futures contracts for corn and other major agricultural commodities trade in the U.S. (Chicago), the EU, South Africa, China and Argentina. The Canadian futures market in Winnipeg (part of ICE) does not trade corn but it does trade canola. The following websites show the current prices and the contract specifications for corn/maize which trade in the five regional ,markets.</p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Standardized Contracts</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>By completing the previous exercise you should have learned that a corn contract that trades on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) trades in units of 5000 bushels whereas each EU corn contract is 50 metric tonnes. As well, CME corn contracts trade for delivery in March, May, July, September and December for the current year and almost three additional years. Finally, the last trading day for CME corn contracts is the 15th day of the expiry month.</p> 
        
    <p>Standardization within a futures contract means that the only variable to be negotiated by the buyer and seller when first entering the contract is the transaction price. The combination of centralized trading and standardization leads to highly efficient price discovery and risk transfer.</p>

    <p>You may be wondering how product quality is standardized. Typically the futures contract is specified for a #2 grade of the product. A premium is specified if a higher grade is delivered, and a discount is specified if a lower grade is delivered.</p> 

    <p>You may also be wondering how to read the price information for CME-traded commodities. For example, 
        <a href = "https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn.html" target="_blank">CME Corn</a>   
    may be shown as trading at 378'6. The "378" refers to 378 cents per bushel, and the " '6 " refers to 6/8 (or 3/4 of a cent). Thus, 378'6 is equivalent to $3.7875 dollars per bushel.</p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Clearing House</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>An important drawback of a decentralized forward contract is counterparty risk. Because the price will increase or decrease after the forward contract is signed the buyer of the seller will have an incentive to not honour the contract. This type of counterparty risk is not present in a futures market because the clearing house serves as an intermediary for all trades.</p> 

    <p>As its name suggests, after trading is complete each day the clearing house calculates profits and losses and updates the traders' margin accounts. By requiring traders to maintain a margin balance and forcing a trader out of the market if his or her margin balance falls below a threshold level, the clearing house ensures that all financial committments are honoured by all traders.</p>

    <p> Given that the clearing house is an active partner in each trade, does the clearing house ever have to source grain to fulfill its futures contract obligation to make delivery? Similarly, does the clearing house ever have to accept grain to fulfill its futures contract obligation to accept delivery? The following example will demonstrate that the answer to both questions is "no".</p>

    <p>Suppose there are three individuals (A, B and C) who took a buy (long) position in corn futures and three other individuals (D, E and F) who took a sell (short) position. Suppose in the original transaction, A and C were paired, B and E were paired and C and F were paired (keep in mind that each futures contract requires one buyer and one seller). Individuals A, B and C have an obligation to accept delivery at the negotiated price (typically different for each of the three individuals) and individuals D, E and F have an obligation to make delivery. In its role as an intermediary, the clearing house has the obligation to make delivery to A, B and C, and accept delivery from D, E and F. The supply of corn that the clearing house receives from D, E and F will always exactly match the amount that it is required to deliver to individuals A, B and C. This means that the clearing house is never required to buy or sell corn externally.</p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Contract Offsetting</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p> A trader with a long (short) position has the obligation to accept delivery (make delivery) of the commodity at a predetermined date and location. Most traders (perhaps 95 percent for most commodities) do not wish to handle the physical commodity and as such they choose to <u>offset</u> their position prior to the expiry of the futures contract (e.g., a specific date in early December for a December futures contract).</p>

    <p>A trader with a long (short) position in December, 2019 corn can offset by taking a long (short) position in December, 2019 corn. The clearning house updates the traders account by comparing the price difference for the two trades. For example, if a trader took a long December, 2019 corn position when the price was $3.75/bu and subsequently offset by taking a short December, 2019 corn position when the price was $3.90/bu, the clearing house would credit the trader with a $0.15/bu gain. This is because the short is equivalent to selling at $3.90 and the long is equivalent to buying at $3.75.</p>

    <p>The image below shows a price chart for CME corn on January 31, 2019. The middle column shows the various prices, the second last column shows <u>volume</u> and the last column shows <u>open interest</u>. These two variables define daily activity and cumulative activity, respectively.

            <p> <b>Volume</b>: The number of futures trades executed for a particular day. Each trade requires one long and one short position.</p>        
            <p> <b>Open Interest</b>: The number of open contracts as measured by the number of long contracts <u>or</u> short contracts that have not yet been settled (either offset or delivery option chosen). </p>

    <p>The main difference between open interest and volume is that open interest measures the activities of new traders only whereas volume measures the activities of all traders. For example, if trader A is short and trader B is long, and then both offset (i.e., A goes long and B goes short) then open interest does not change but trading volume increases by 2.
    </p>

    <p>Volume is typically largest for the nearby futures contract, although it usually drops off rapidly in the last few days prior to the contract expiring. Open interest typically grows steadily, starting about when the contract is within a year of expiry. When the contact nears the last month of trading prior to expiry open interest typically falls off rapidly as traders offset their positions and take new positions with contracts that have a longer maturity.</p>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a003"></a>(iii) Margin and Marking to Market</h3>

    <p>Traders of commodity futures must maintain a balance in their margin accounts. This balance is large enough to ensure that if the commodity's price moves against the trader, the loss on the trade can be covered by using the funds in the trader's margin account. It is important to distinquish between the two alternative types of margins:</p>
        
    <br/>

    <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 700px; background-color: #0404B4;">
        <div style="position: relative; top: -10px; left: -10px; padding: 10px; background: #CCFFFF; border: 2px solid #0404B4;">
            <p> <b>Initial Margin</b>: The minimum margin account balance when the trader takes a position in a new contract (e.g., $1000 for a 5000 bushel CME corn contract).</p>        
            <p> <b>Maintenance Margin</b>: The minimum amount that must be maintained in the margin account while trading is on going (e.g., $700 for a 5000 bushel CME contract). </p>

    <p> <u>Marking to market</u> means that after each trading session the margin account of each trader is updated with the profits or losses that were incurred for the current trading session. In the previous example, it was shown that when the trader offset her position in the corn market, the clearing house added the $0.15/bu to the trader's margin account. Marking to market means that daily profits and losses are calculated as if the trade was offset at the market's closing price. Marking to market ensures that the trader's margin account balance less the initial margin and margin contributions or withdrawls reflects the cumulative gain or loss in profits on the contract</p>

  <h5><i>Margin and Marketing to Market</i></h5>
  <ol start="6">
      <li>It is well known that futures trading involves considerable leverage because the margin requirements are small relative to the value of the contract. Suppose margin requirements are 10 percent of the market value of the contract. Calculate the rate of return earned on the margin deposit for a 5000 bushel long position assuming the entry price is $8/bu and the offset price is $7.70/bu. </li>  

      <li>Calculate the rate of return if instead the 5000 bushels was purchased in the spot market at $7.60/bu and resold at $7.30/bu. </li>

      <li>Marking to market is an accounting principal that is unique to commodity futures markets. True of False. </li>

  <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="d004"></a>CME Videos: Questions 9 - 12</h3>


  <p><u>9. Definition of a Futures Contract</u></p>

  <p>Fill-in-the-blanks: Futures contracts have a number of variables such as expiry month, quantity and quality of the commodity being traded, transaction price and delivery location. All of these variables other than _______ are standardized (i.e., predetermined at the beginning of the trading session).  The delivery location that is specified by most agricultural commodity CME futures contracts is _____________. The delivery location for Canadian canola on the ICE exchange is __________. For CME corn, the minimum amount that price is allowed to fluctuate while trading is taking place is equal to ______________ cents/bushel. The incentive for a buyer or seller to back away from a forward contract if price moves in unprofitable direction is referred to as ________ risk. </p> 

  <p><u>10. Get to Know Futures Expiration and Settlement</u></p>

  <p>Fill-in-the-blanks. A December corn contract expires on approximately what day in December. Prior to the expiry of a contract, the individual can ______ the contract as a way to avoid accepting or making delivery of the commodity. This "early exit" allows individuals who do not have grain storage facilities to trade commodity futures, which provides market (concentration, liquidity, transparency - choose one). Suppose Cargill takes a short December futures position for CME corn and does not offset this position prior to the expiry of the contract on December 15th. This means that Cargill must (make, accept - choose one) delivery of the corn on December 15th. Agricultural commodities are a bit unusual to have settlement of the physical commodity rather than a ______ settlement.  </p>

  <p><u>11. Calculating Futures Contract Profit and Loss</u></p>

  <p>Fill-in-the-blanks: When trading futures the tick size is equivalent to the minimum price fluctuation. The tick size for CME corn is ____ cents per bushel. This means that if the price increases from 375'6 to 377'2 we can equivalently say that the price has increased by ____ ticks. The size of a CME corn contract is _________ bushels. Multiplying the tick size by the number ticks the price has changed by the size of the contract gives the total profit or loss on the price movement. A trader with a long position for two CME corn contracts will (gain, lose - choose one) a total of _____ dollars if the price of corn changes from 375'6 to 377'2. Not that there are limits as to how much a price can decrease or increase in a single trading session. The maximum daily price change for CME corn is ______ cents per bushel.</p>

  <p><u>12. Futures Contracts Compared to Forward Contracts</u></p>

  <p>Fill-in-the-blanks: Over-the-counter trading implies that trades take place in (centralized, decentralized - choose one) locations. Decentralized trading has a (high, low - choose one) level of efficiency from a price determination perspective. Farmers routinely use (futures, forward - choose one) contracts when locking in the price of a commodity with their local grain buyer. Forward contracts are typically not traded and for this reason have comparatively (high, low - choose) value for a speculator. With a forward contract, a (buyer, seller - choose one) has an incentive to walk away from the contract if the commodity price increases from when the forward contract is signed and when the commodity is scheduled to be delivered.</p>
