    <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a001"></a>(i) Price Discovery</h3>
        
    <p>As noted in the previous module, an important role of commodity futures markets is price discovery. In an an attempt to earn profits, speculators trade commodity futures based on their knowledge and beliefs about current and future supply and demand conditions. The equilibrium futures prices that are reported and continually updated throughout the trading day reflect the aggregation of speculators' current knowledge and beliefs about market fundamentals.</p>

    <p>
        <hr align="left" width="50%">
        <blockquote><font size="4">Simple Example</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>The following simple example will help you better understand price discovery. The demand for wheat in each of two periods is the same and can be expressed in inverse form as P = 150 - Q. In period 1 supply is known to equal 70 units. This supply will partially be consumed in period 1 and the remainder will be stored (at zero cost) and then consumed in Period 2. When futures trading is taking place in period 1, production for period 2 is uncertain and thus must be estimated by the 21 speculators who actively trade wheat futures. </p>

    <p> It is useful to arrange the speculators from the most bullish to most bearish regarding beliefs about period 2 price. A bullish (bearish) speculator believes period 2 production will be relatively low (high) and therefore the set of period 1 and 2 prices will be relatively high (low). Speculator 1 believes period 2 production will equal 40 units. Speculator 2 believes period 2 production will equal 41 units. And so forth all the way to speculator 21 who believes period 2 production will equal 60 units.</p>

    <p> Given their individual beliefs, the speculators must make an assumption about how much wheat will be stored between period 1 and period 2. We can model these beliefs using the assumption of rational expectations. As will be explained below, speculators should rationally expect that 10 units will be stored between period 1 and period 2. Speculator 1 should therefore expect period 2 supply to equal 10 + 40 = 50 units, and period 2 price to equal P = 150 - 50 = 100. Similarly, speculator 2 should expect period 2 supply to equal to 10 + 41 = 51 units and price to equal P = 150 - 51 = 99. And so forth.</p>

    <p> Suppose in period 1 a futures contract that calls for period 2 delivery is trading at P = 95. Speculator 1 will bid to take a long position because she will expect to later offset with a short position when the period 2 price is P = 100. If speculator 1's beliefs about period 2 production are correct then she will earn 100 - 95 = 5 in speculative profits. Speculators 2 through 5 will also bid for long positions because of positive expected profits. Speculator 7 expects period 2 production to equal 46 units and thus period 2 price to equal P = 150 - (10 + 46) = 94. Given that period 2 futures are trading at P = 95 speculator 2 will bid for a short position because she will later offset with a long position when she expects the period 2 price to equal P = 94. If speculator 7's beliefs about period 2 production are correct then she will earn 95 - 94 = 1 in speculative profits. Speculators 8 through 21 will also bid for short positions because of positive expected profits.</p>

    <p>It should be clear that P = 95 is not an equilibrium futures price because the demand for short contracts by speculators 7 through 21 exceeds the demand for long contracts by speculators 1 through 5. The excess demand for short contracts will cause the futures price to be bid down to P = 90. At this price speculators 1 through 10 will bid long and speculators 12 through 21 will bid short. Speculator 10 will not bid for any position because she expects zero profits at this price. P = 90 is the equilibrium futures price because the number of speculators who are bidding long is equal to the number of speculators who are bidding short. Through individual speculators seeking profits the futures price has been discovered.</p>

    <p> It was previously assumed that speculators should rationally expect the market to store 10 units between periods 1 and 2. Storing 10 units implies 70 - 10 = 60 units are available for consumption in the first period and thus the period 1 spot price will equal P = 150 - 60 = 90. Given that the equilibrium futures price for period 2 is also equal to P = 90 it follows that traders seeking arbitrage profits do not have an incentive to store more or less than 10 units. We therefore have a joint equilibrium in the spot market for the physical commodity and in the futures market.</p>

    <p>Using this simple example it should be obvious what happens to the futures price if one or more of the speculators receive updated information about period 2 production. For example, suppose speculator 1 receives information that causes her to believe that period 2 production will equal Q = 35 rather than Q = 40. If the futures price is P = 90 this speculator will bid for additional long positions because she believes the period 2 offset price will equal P = 150 - (10 + 35) = 105. This excess demand for long contracts will bid the futures price up until a new equilibrium price has been established. Hopefully you can now understand the claim that the prevailing futures price reflects the full set of speculator information and beliefs.</p>

    <p>
        <hr align="left" width="50%">
        <blockquote><font size="4">Fundamentals of Supply and Demand</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>As the previous example shows, price determination by speculators in a futures market is complicated because it is necessary to predict the flow of stocks over time (i.e., storage) and up-and-coming market fundamentals (i.e., supply and demand). Fortunately the flow of stocks and future market fundamentals are closely related. For example, a favourable weather report will cause traders to increase their estimate of the size of the up-and-coming harvest and decrease their estimate of stock inflows. Stock inflows are downgraded because the larger harvest will result in lower prices in the future and so more of the commodity is consumed immediately rather than being stored for future consumption. </p>

    <p>Consider the following market February 4, 2019 commentary from an analyst at FarmProgress.com.</p>

    <p><i>Soybeans are a little lower, pulling back from Friday's six-week high. Positive news from trade talks last week as well as continued dry weather in Brazil are boosting U.S. export hopes, at least a little.</i></p>

    <p>The explains the late January, 2019 rally in the price of soybeans, which is clearly illustrated in the chart below. Price is higher because the market expects higher global demand (particularly China) for U.S. soybeans. Demand is expected to be higher because trade talks will eventually result in the elimination of soybean tariffs (which were imposed in 2018 as part of a broader trade war). Moreover, drier growing conditions in Brazil implies the expectation of lower production and lower futures sales of soybeans by Brazil.</p>

    <p>Weather is a very important determinant of prices for dryland crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat. Reports during the North American growing season (May to October) and the South American growing season (October to May) can result in large price swings. It is common for prices to surge with an unanticipated report of frost or hail damage. An expectedly large rainfall when a region is experiencing drought conditions can cause prices to tumble. Winter kill and flooding are also important considerations as can be seen in the following February 4, 2019 FarmProgress.com commentary:</p> 

    <p><i>Wheat prices are steady to a little lower this morning as traders wait for export news and assess damage from last week's Polar Vortex. Winterkill is notoriously hard to predict, though flooding could be an issue in February from the Delta through the Ohio River Valley for soft red winter wheat.</i></p>

    <p>Monthly USDA World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) reports are released after the conclusion of Friday trading. Depending on the extent that the estimates were not anticipated by traders, opening prices will often jump up or down by a significant amount the following Monday. According to analysts the 
    <a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/3t945q76s/nz806541q/6682x9431/latest.pdf" target="_blank">February, 2019 report </a>
    was not particularly newsworthy and so the Monday market did not move very much in response to the report's release.</p>

    <p>The strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies such as the Euro and the Chinese Yuan is also an important determinant of commodity future prices. The following March 20, 2010 excerpt from 
    <a href="https://www.farmprogress.com/grains/do-corn-prices-follow-value-us-dollar" target="_blank">FarmProgress.com </a>
    describes the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar: </p>

    <p><i>From the side of the U.S. corn importer, a lower valued dollar in relation to the currency of that country, all else equal, is in effect a reduction in the price of corn. A lower price to the importer might be expected to result in larger imports. That is, there would be a movement down the demand curve to a new, larger equilibrium of quantity supplied and quantity demanded.</i></p>

    <p><i>For the U.S. market, larger exports at the same nominal price of corn is in effect an increase in demand. That is, there is an upward shift in the demand curve for U.S. corn. In turn, the increase in demand results in a higher equilibrium price of corn. Theoretically then, a lower-valued U.S. dollar should result in larger exports and a higher nominal price in the United States, assuming no change in other price factors.</i></p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Stocks-to-Use Ratio</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>A useful measure that combines commodity supply and demand is the stocks-to-use ratio. Theory predicts a higher price for a lower stocks-to-use ratio and vice versa. As would be expected, the sensitivity of price to changes in the stocks-to-use ratio is highest when the ratio is either relatively small or relatively large in value.</p>

    <p>The first graph below from the
            <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/wheat-reports.html" target="_blank">CME </a>

    <p>Notice from Figures 1-B-2 and 1-B-3 that during the 2000 to 2007 period, price steadily climbed while the stocks-to-use ratio steadidly fell. A second price surge corresponds to a second drop in the stocks-to-use ratio over the 2010 to 2014 period. The steady increase in the stocks-to-use ratio in recent years corresponds to the on-going price decline since 2013.</p>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a002"></a>(ii) Storage Dynamics and Seasonality</h3>
        
    <p>Storage is a key component of futures markets as is illustrated by the following example. Consider the price of a November soybean contract that is being traded in early June. The price of this contract is typically impacted after the USDA releases a report that estimates the number of acres of soybeans that were planted by U.S. farmers during the spring planting period. If the estimate is higher (lower) than what the market was anticipating then the price of November futures will be bid down (up). The reason for this price reaction should be obvious. But what is less obvious is the storage response, which is an important determinant of the November price. If the acreage estimate is higher than expected, then more soybeans will be sold in the pre-harvest period (i.e., June to September) and fewer soybeans will be sold post-harvest (i.e., after October). This change in storage implies less of a price reduction in the November contract than what would be the case if there is was no adjustment in storage. The situation is similar if the acreage estimate is lower than expected.</p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Cost and Benefit of Storage</font> </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>Storage entails both a cost and benefit for merchants who deal with the physical commodity.</p>  
            
    <br/>
        
    <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 700px; background-color: #0404B4;">
        <div style="position: relative; top: -10px; left: -10px; padding: 10px; background: #CCFFFF; border: 2px solid #0404B4;">
                <p><b>Cost of Storage: </b>Physical storage cost + opportunity cost of capital</p>
                <p><b>Benefit of Storage: </b>Convenience yield</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    
    <p>The physical cost of storage is the price of warehouse services (including insurance). This cost typically is higher (lower) when aggregate stocks are higher (lower) because less cost efficient storage facilities must be used for larger inventories. The opportunity cost of capital is the lost interest earning associated with the value of the inventory tied up in stocks rather than being sold and the proceeds invested. This opportunity cost, which also accounts for inventory spoilage, is generally proportional to the price of the commodity (e.g., 5 percent per year). In the model below the combined marginal physical cost of storage and opportunity cost of capital for period t is modeled as k<sub>t</sub> = k<sub>0</sub> + k<sub>1</sub>S<sub>t</sub> where S<sub>t</sub> is a measure of stocks at the end of period t. </p> 

    <p>Convenience yield is the implicit benefit that merchants receive from having stocks close at hand to fill unexpected orders and avoid the transaction cost of purchasing inventory on a repeated basis. Convenience yield is typically inversely related to stocks because the convenience of having stocks close at hand is lower when stocks are plentiful and can easily be purchased in an external market. Convenience yield is equivalent to a negative cost of storage because it is by definition a benefit rather than a cost. In the model below marginal convenience yield is modeled as C<sub>t</sub> = c<sub>0</sub> - c<sub>1</sub>S<sub>t</sub>. </p>

                        The marginal carrying cost, denoted m<sub>t</sub>, is defined as the marginal cost of storage minus the marginal convenience yield: m<sub>t</sub> = m<sub>0</sub> + m<sub>1</sub>S<sub>t</sub>, where  m<sub>0</sub> = k<sub>0</sub> - c<sub>0</sub> and m<sub>1</sub> = k<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>1</sub>.

        <blockquote><font size="4">Willingness to Store and Price Dynamics </font> </blockquote>
    </p>
    
    <p>A merchant is willing to store the commodity only if the expected price gain over the period the commodity is stored is sufficient to cover the merchant's marginal carrying cost. If the expected price gain exceeds the marginal carrying cost then many merchants will want to hold stocks, and this excess demand will drive up the current price. In a competitive market the price will be driven up until the expected price gain is exactly equal to the marginal carrying cost. This concept is equivalent to an intertemporal law of one price (LOP). When prices over time are in equilibrium a pair of prices at two different points of time (e.g., January and March) are expected to be equal after adjusting for the marginal convenience yield. This LOP concept is worth emphasizing.  </p>

            <p> This relationship holds only for expected prices. Actual prices will typically not follow this formula due to the arrival of new information. </p> 
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In the section to follow a simulation model is constructed and calibrated to the U.S. corn market. It is important that the model make reasonably accurate predictions about real world prices. The model assumes that each time period is a three month interval (i.e., a quarter). The years are based on a crop year rather than a calendar year. Thus, Q1 is September to November, Q2 is December to February, Q3 is March to May and Q4 is June to August. These quarters roughly correspond to fall, winter, spring and summer.</p>

    <p>Figure 1-B-4 shows the long term average price of corn for each of the four quarters. The quarterly averages were calculated usimg data from 1980 - 2018. These prices illustrate the intertemporal LOP relationship which was presented in the previous textbox. The price is lowest during the Q1 harvest season and then climbs for the next two quarters. Between Q1 and Q3 the price increase is relatively large because the marginal storage cost is relatively high and the marginal convenience yield is relativel low. By Q3 stocks are starting to run low, which results in a relatively low marginal cost of storage and a relative high marginal convenience yield. In fact, by Q4 the marginal convenience yield is greater than the marginal cost of storage, which results in a negative marginal carrying cost and thus a price decrease between Q3 and Q4 rather than a price decrease. If the prices are graphed for eight quarters rather than four, we would see a relative large price decrease between Q4 of the old crop year and Q1 of the new crop year. This large drop reflects the rapid increase in the marginal cost of storage and the rapid decrease in the marginal convenience yield with the arrival of the new harvest. It is important to keep in mind that the P<sub>t+1</sub> = P<sub>t </sub> + m<sub>0</sub> + m<sub>1</sub>S<sub>t</sub> pricing relationship continues to hold when transitioning from the old crop year to the new crop year.</p>

    <p>The take-away message is that the intertemporal LOP equation is a key component of the seasonal pricing pattern which we observe in the markets for most grains which have an annual harvest. Economists routinely use econometric analysis to test this theory but there is one major problem: convenience yield cannot be observed. At the farm level, convenience yield has little relevance because farmers are intent on selling their commodity for the highest net price after accounting for their actual cost of storage. On the other hand it is reasonable to believe that processors receive a great deal of convenience from having stocks on hand. Some economists have modeled convenience yield as an option value in an uncertain environment. Other economists simply view convenience yield as a "fudge factor" which ensures that the intertemporal LOP holds by assumption. We will not worry about these distinctions. What is important is that it is common to see firms carrying over inventory from the old crop year to the new crop year even though they know prices will be lower with the arrival of the new harvest. If the level of carry over drops to a critically low level then we say the market has "stocked out". In this case the LOP relationship becomes P<sub>t+1</sub> < P<sub>t </sub> + m<sub>0</sub> + m<sub>1</sub>S<sub>t</sub> with S<sub>t</sub> = 0 because it is not possible to carry over negative stocks. </p>

    <h3 style="color:rgb(128, 0, 0);"><a name="a003"></a>(iii) Simulation Model</h3>

    <p>The model presented in this section is a simplified version of the model presented in a recent <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/jvercammen/files/2020/08/Commodity_Pricing_July2020.pdf" target="_blank">research paper</a> by Professor Vercammen. For this class production uncertainty has been eliminated to simplify the mathematics. The model consists of two marketing years with four quarters per year. Stocks at level S<sub>0</sub> are in place when the model begins. We start the analysis with harvest for year 1 (at level H<sub>1</sub>) just wrapping up. The total inventory of S<sub>0</sub> + H<sub>1</sub> is consumed domestically and exported over the next four quarters. The amount of year 1 stocks which are carried over and combined with the year 2 harvest depends on how expected prices in year 2 compare with actual prices in year 1 (i.e., the carry over level is endogenous in the model). Year 2 is the same as year 1 except beginning stocks in Q5 (i.e., the harvest season of the second year) is typically different than S<sub>0</sub>, and stocks at the end of Q8 are restricted to equal a predetermined value, S<sub>8</sub>. For the base case we assume S<sub>8</sub> = S<sub>0</sub>.</p> 
    
    <p>The commodity inventory is sold in both the domestic market (e.g., the U.S. midwest) and the export market (e.g., the U.S. Gulf Coast). Let X<sub>t</sub> denote quarter t sales to the domestic market and let N<sub>t</sub> denote quarter t sales to the export market. The inverse demand schedule in the domestic market, P<sub>t</sub> = a - bX<sub>t</sub>, is assumed to be the same for each quarter. The region in question is assumed to be a price taker in the world market and thus it faces a fixed export price, P<sub>0</sub>. This assumption is not very realistic if the domestic market is the U.S. midwest but nevertheless it is maintained because it greatly simplifies the analysis and the main results would be qualitatively similar if this assumption was relaxed. The commodity is transported from the domestic market to the export market by rail and barge. Assume that the cost per unit of commodity which is transported is a linear increasing function of total export sales:  n<sub>0</sub> + n<sub>1</sub>N<sub>t</sub>. This assumption reflects the fact that rail and barge capacity is limited and therefore the service cost is higher when the systems becomes more congested.   </p> 

    <p>The equations which make up this model can be expressed as follows:</p>

    <br/>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 700px; background-color: #0404B4;">
        <div style="position: relative; top: -10px; left: -10px; padding: 10px; background: #CCFFFF; border: 2px solid #0404B4;">
            <li> Equation (1): P<sub>t+1</sub> = P<sub>t </sub> + m<sub>0</sub> + m<sub>1</sub>S<sub>t</sub> </li> 
            <li> Equation (2): P<sub>t</sub> = P<sub>0 </sub> - (n<sub>0</sub> + n<sub>1</sub>N<sub>t</sub>) </li> 
            <li> Equation (3): P<sub>t</sub> = a - bX<sub>t</sub> </li> 
            <li> Equation (4): S<sub>t</sub> = S<sub>t-1 </sub> + H<sub>t</sub> - X<sub>t</sub> - N<sub>t</sub> </li>           
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>Equation (1) is the intertemporal LOP, which was presented and discussed in the previous section. Equation (2) is the spatial LOP because it shows that the price in the domestic market and the export market are the same after adjusting for the cost of transporting the commodity bewtween the two markets. Equation (3) is the domestic inverse demand schedule. Equation (4) is referred to as the equation of motion because it shows how stocks evolve over time. Specifically, stocks carried out of quater t + 1 are equal to stocks carried into quarter t + 1 (these are the same as stocks carried out of quarter t) plus harvest if in Q1 or Q5 minus the amount which is consumed domestically or exported. Together with the assumption that S<sub>0</sub> and S<sub>8</sub> have predetermined values, this system of equations can be solved to give us a set of solution values for domestic consumption (X<sub>t</sub>), exports (N<sub>t</sub>), stocks (S<sub>t</sub>) and the domestic price (P<sub>t</sub>).   </p>

        <blockquote><font size="4">Model Calibration </font> </blockquote>
    </p>
            
    <p>The simulation model is calibrated to roughly correspond to U.S. corn production. The details of the calibration can be found in Professor Vercammen's <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/jvercammen/files/2020/08/Commodity_Pricing_July2020.pdf" target="_blank">working paper </a>. The specific parameter values are in the top left corner of the "Main" worksheet of "Commodity Pricing Model.xlsx", which you will be using as part of FRE 501. A screen shot of these values are shown in Figure 1-B-5. The left column contains the set of base case values - these never change. The right column contains the set of "what if" values, some of which you will change as part of your learning process. The model allows the year 2 domestic demand schedule to shift either in or out relative to the year 1 demand curve. This is accomplished by setting the intercept value for the year 2 demand schedule, a-hat, different than the intercept value for the year 1 demand curve, a. The model also allows the export price of the commodity in year 2, denoted P_0_hat, to be different than the export price of the commodity in year 1, denoted P_0. </p> 

        <div class=figure>

        </div>   

     <p>The pricing model has five what-if options for you to experiment with. These five options are shown in Figure 1-B-6. The pair of settings on the left allow you to adjust the forecast for global corn demand and supply relative to the base case (e.g., 10 percent greater than the base case). Each combination of global supply and demand which you choose results in a unique value for the year 2 export price, P_0_hat. Setting global demand above (below) the base case and supply below (above) the base case will obviously raise (lower) the value of P_0_hat relative to the base case value of P_0 = 5.  The middle what if setting in Figure 1-B-6 allows you to adjust year 2 harvest and domestic demand relative to the base case. The supply adjustment changes the H_5 parameter. The demand adjustment increases or decreases the value of the year 2 demand intercept, a_hat. The what if setting on the right of Figure 1-B-6 allows you to adjust the value of the beginning stocks parameter, S_0.</p> 
     
     <p>When conducting the what if analysis it is important to keep in mind that you are at the the beginning of Q1 and are assessing how stocks, domestic consumption exports and prices will evolve over the next eight quarters. You make your assessment by calibrating the model using the base case parameter values (assume these values come from the most recent USDA report on supply and demand conditions). While still at the beginning of Q1 you receive an updated USDA report and you notice that one or more parameters concerning future supply and demand have changed. The what if analysis in the discussion below corresponds to the changes contained in the updated USDA report.       </p>

    </p>
    
    <p> Figures 1-B-7 and 1-B-8 below show the base case outcome with a what if scenario of 10 percent higher global production in year 2 as compared to the year 1 base. This higher production corresponds to a decrease in the export price from $5.00/bu down to to $4.50/bu. Consider first the base case prices, which are given by the blue columns in Figure 1-B-8. Notice that the pattern of prices over time are similar to long term average prices from the U.S. corn market, which are shown in Figure 1-B-4. Keep in mind that it is the declining marginal storage costs and the increasing convenience yield which gives rise to this particular pricing pattern. The blue and green columns in Figure 1-B-7 show the base case pattern of domestic consumption and exports, respectfully. During Q1 through Q3 consumption declines due to the rising domestic price, and in Q4 consumption increases slightly due to the decline in the domestic price. Similarly, during Q1 through Q3 exports decline because the rise in the domestic price and the constant values for the export price implies a smaller price margin for exporters. The green line graph in Figure 1-B-8 shows how stocks change over time. As expected, stocks steadily decrese from Q1 through Q4, a small amount of stocks are carried over to year 2 due to a high convenience yield, and then stocks jump back up with the arrival of the year 2 harvest. Keep in mind that stocks are measured at end of each period and thus domestic consumptiona and exports have already been removed.</p>

    </div>  
    
    <p> The columns immediately to the right of the base case columns in Figures 1-B-7 and 1-B-8 show the results for the what if scenario. The gold line graph in Figure 1-B-8 shows that the announcement of 10 percent higher global production and thus a lower export price in year 2 results in reduced stocks moving through time. This is expected because the current value of the stocks has increased relative to the future value. The reduction in stocks moving forward through time implies highler levels of consmption and exports in year 1 (see the orange and yellow columns in Figure 1-B-7). With the fall in the export price in year 2, domestic consumption jumps sharply upward and exports jump sharply downward for Q5 through Q8. Again, this result is expected. The orange columns in Figure 1-B-8 shows that the announcement of a lower export price in year 2 causes the set of prices in year 1 to drop down moderately, and the set of prices in year 2 to drop down sharply. This is expected because in year 1 the higher level of consumption must be accompanied by lower prices, and in year 2 the sharp rise in domestic consumption and drop in exports must be accompanied by a sharp reduction in the domestic price. </p>

    <p>You will have the opportunity in class to work through the other what if scenarios. Challenge yourself to ask what will happen to year 1 and year 2 consumption, exports, stocks and prices before changing the what if parameter(s) and observing the simulated results. This will force you to think through the various economics linkages. Keep in mind that it takes a lot of practice to become good at thinking through the various moving parts when predicting how the variables of interest will change when revised information about future supply and conditions is received. With sufficient practice you will be able to interpret the daily commodity price reports with this mental model in mind. And for those of you who are participating in the Stock Trak trading game, having knowledge of the various linkages concerning stocks, consumption, exports and prices will help you make informed and hopefully profitable trades in the commodity futures market. Speaking of futures markets, now that we understand how spot prices are determined it is time to use this same model to examine futures prices and how the relationship between spot and futures prices evolves over time.

    <h3>Assignment 1, Question 4: Price Discovery</h3>

    <p>There is just one period and there are zero corn stocks at the beginning of the period. Production and consumption take place at the end of the period. A futures market is operating at the beginning of the period. Inverse demand for corn is given by P = 100 - 10Q. There are 40 different production outcomes ranging from Q = 4 to Q = 5 in increments of 0.025. There are 100 speculators who have different beliefs about the production outcomes. These beliefs are summarized in an <a href="other_1b/belief_data.xlsx">Excel worksheet</a>. Believing that production will be at level Q<sub>0</sub> is equivalent to believing that price will equal P = 100 – 10Q<sub>0</sub>. Construct an Excel worksheet which allows you to identify the total number of speculators who demand a long position and the total number who demand a short position as a function of the futures price, F. Your job is to identify the equilibrium futures price, F<sup>*</sup>, which ensures that the total demand for long positions is approximately equal to the total demand for short positions. Do not round off numbers – assume that the number of speculators can be a fraction rather than only an integer. </p>

            <ol type="a">
                <li>When comparing actual prices in Q1 through Q4 and expected prices in Q5 through Q8, Figure 1-B-7 better illustrates the saw toothed pattern of prices.</li>
                <li>If the probability of a year 2 production loss was set above 0.5 we would expect the Q2 price to increase in Figure 1-B-6 and not change in Figure 1-B-7.</li>
                <li>If the probability of a year 2 production loss was set above 0.5 we would expect the Q2 price to increase in Figure 1-B-7 and not change in Figure 1-B-6.</li>
                <li>None of the above.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Consider Figure 1-B-7. Suppose in Q2 traders receive credible information that the year 2 harvest will experience a loss with 100 percent certainty.  
           
            <ol type="a">
                <li>The price will drop with the arrival of the year 2 harvest:  P<sub>5</sub> < P<sub>4 </sub> + m<sub>0</sub> + m<sub>1</sub>S<sub>4</sub></li>
                <li>The price will increase with the arrival of the year 2 harvest by amount which exceeds the carrying cost: P<sub>5</sub> > P<sub>4 </sub> + m<sub>0</sub> + m<sub>1</sub>S<sub>4</sub></li>
                <li>The price will increase with the arrival of the year 2 harvest by amount which is equal to the carrying cost: P<sub>5</sub> = P<sub>4 </sub> + m<sub>0</sub> + m<sub>1</sub>S<sub>4</sub></li>
                <li>The announcement will have no impact on the Q4 price.</li>
